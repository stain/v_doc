  <h2>Foreword</h2>





The IBM Common User Access* guidelines are intended to help product
designers and developers create an interface that the user will find
easy to learn and use. They are based on sound principles of interface
design and on object-oriented relationships. Moreover, the guidelines
reflect recent advances in personal computing technology and the growing demand
by users that computers match their way of thinking.<br />





  <br />




The object-oriented workplace shell of IBM's new OS/2* 2.0 operating
system is based on these guidelines. OS/2 2.0 users can interact
intuitively and easily with objects because each object clearly
represents a real workplace&nbsp;task. Thus a user can transfer
knowledge
about an object from the real world to the computer environment. The
user can also
transfer knowledge from one product to another, as well as predict how
something new will work, thanks to consistent interface design. <br />





  <br />





As a result, end users of CUA products should experience higher
productivity and satisfaction, while producing fewer errors.<br />





  <br />





This official guide, which combines two books originally published in
the fall of 1991, is divided into two sections. The first--the "CUA
Design Guide"--describes principles, components and techniques of user
interface design and describes the process of designing a product with
a CUA interface. The "CUA Reference" section identifies the CUA interface
features, or components, and provides guidelines for using them.<br />





  <br />





We in IBM are especially proud of the <cite>Object-Oriented</cite>
  <cite>Interface</cite>
  <cite>Design. </cite>It
is the work of a team of talented people at IBM. Their effort was
recognized recently when they received the Thomas J. Watson, Jr.,
Design Excellence Award. As the award noted, "The CUA Design is
revolutionary, in that it places a user's data first and foremost."<br />





  <br />





I hope these guidelines contribute to your excellence by helping you
make the users of your applications more productive in their personal computing.<br />

  <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">About
This Book</h1>





This book describes the guidelines that define the Common User
Access*(CUA*) user interface. The Common User Access (CUA) user
interface is an object-oriented graphical user interface that provides a
consistent look and feel for products that adopt the CUA interface as
their standard.<br />





  
  
  
  
  <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">How
This Book is
Organized</h2>





This book has two parts plus appendixes and a glossary.<br />





  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>&nbsp;<a href="1.0?DT=19921204095534#HDRPART1"><b>Part</b> <b>1,</b> <b>"CUA</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Guide"</b></a>&nbsp;describes principles, components, and techniques of
user interface design in general, as applied to a variety of software
products for a variety of operating environments. Although it describes
the process of designing a product with a CUA interface in particular,
Part 1, "CUA Design Guide" is not a "cookbook" for producing a product
with a CUA interface; instead, it is more like a textbook, intended to
expose designers to the concepts that they should consider when
designing any kind of user interface.</li>





    <li><a href="2.0?DT=19921204095534#HDRPART2"><b>Part</b> <b>2,</b> <b>"CUA</b> <b>Reference"</b></a>&nbsp;identifies the CUA interface components and lists all of the
fundamental and recommended guidelines for designing and developing a
product with a CUA interface for a programmable workstation. It
provides an alphabetically arranged list of the interface components
that are defined in the CUA interface. The graphical representations
shown are examples only and are not intended to define how a component
should appear in the interface for a particular product.<br />





    </li>





  
  
  
  
  </ul>




  <br />




Note that neither <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 1</span> nor <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part 2</span> tells a designer how to create a
specific product or part of a product. That is, the CUA guidelines do
not tell a designer how to design an accounting product or a balance
sheet, for example.<br />





  <br />





  
  
  
  
  <ul>





    <li>The Appendixes contain the
following information:<br />





      
      
      
      
      <ul>





        <li>Design considerations
for multimedia and touch input</li>





        <li>Design considerations
for the use of color</li>





        <li>CUA interface National
Language Support</li>





        <li>Help for documenting the
CUA interface in product publications and online information. </li>

designers, although programmers will want to read it to gain a general
knowledge of the Common User Access user interface and the design
process. You should be familiar with icons, windows, menus, and other
components of graphical user interfaces, as well as with interaction
techniques involving a pointing device, such as a mouse.<br />

  <pre width="80"><br />A <i>user</i> <i>interface</i> is the set of techniques and mechanisms that a person uses to interact with an object. Any kind of object has a user interface, and an object's interface is developed according to a user's needs and reasons for using the object. A user interface can be a set of buttons, like those on a telephone or video recorder. In the case of a computer, a user interface can include a keyboard, a pointing device, and the items that appear on a display screen. The user interface is the means by which a user communicates with a computer and vice versa. Many types of user interfaces are available for computers, including:<br /><br />&deg; Command-line user interfaces, in which a user remembers commands and types them<br /><br />&deg; Menu-driven user interfaces, in which a user is provided with a hierarchically organized set of choices<br /><br />&deg; Graphical user interfaces, in which a user points to and interacts with visible elements of the interface by using a pointing device.<br /></pre>

  </h2>






  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />The Common User Access user interface is a graphical user interface that incorporates elements of <i>object</i> <i>orientation,</i> an orientation in which a user's focus is on objects and in which the concept of applications is hidden. Objects and object orientation are discussed in more detail in <a href="1.1.3?DT=19921204095534#HDROOINCUA">"Object Orientation in the CUA User Interface" in topic 1.1.3</a>. The CUA user interface is based on principles of user-interface design, on object-oriented relationships, and on field experience and user testing.<br /><br />The CUA guidelines provide information about how the model on which a product is based should be conveyed to a user. The CUA guidelines also include specific details about designing and developing computer software and user interfaces. Products that adhere to the CUA guidelines and undergo usability testing should be comparatively easy to learn and use. As a result, users of products with a CUA user interface should find the products satisfying to use, efficient, and appropriate for the tasks that the users want to accomplish.<br /></pre>

<pre width="80"><br /></pre>



<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: monospace; width: 640px;">Although
this book is intended for product designers, the CUA user interface
itself is intended for a group of end users known as "knowledge
workers." This group includes the many people around the world who make
their living by working with information, which provides the basis for
the decisions they make. These people might work in offices or in
airplanes or anywhere they can have access to a computer.<br />

However, the CUA user interface is not necessarily appropriate for
every possible user of computers. For example, the CUA user interface
might not be the most efficient interface for someone who performs a
single, highly specialized task, such as the tasks in manufacturing
process control or in retail sales. The CUA interface is most
appropriate for users who perform a variety of information-related
tasks.</span><br />

  </h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />Graphical user interfaces, including the CUA interface, are becoming more object-oriented. Object-oriented user interfaces allow for the development of a cohesive working environment in which each element, called an <i>object,</i> can interact with every other element. The objects that users require to perform their tasks and the objects used by the operating environment can work cooperatively in one seamless interface. That is, the boundaries that distinguish applications from operating systems are no longer apparent to users.<br /><br />The most readily apparent feature of an object-oriented user interface is the pervasive focus on objects, as well as the principles applied to those objects, such as <i>object</i> <i>classes,</i> <i>object</i> <i>hierarchies,</i> and <i>inheritance.</i> These are discussed in the following sections.<br /></pre>

  <h2><a id="HDROBJS" name="HDROBJS">1.1.4 Objects</a></h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />In the real world, an object is an item that a person requires to perform work. For example, an accountant's objects might include a ledger and a calculator. An architect's objects might include blueprints, a T square, and a sharp pencil. In the CUA environment, an object is any visual component of a user interface that a user can work with as a unit, independent of other items, to perform a task. A spreadsheet, one cell in a spreadsheet, a bar chart, one bar in a bar chart, a report, a paragraph in a report, a database, one record in a database, and a printer are all objects. Each object can be represented by one or more graphic images, called icons, that a user can interact with, much as a user can interact<br />with objects in the real world.<br /><br />However, an object need not always be represented by an <i>icon,</i> and not all  interaction is accomplished by way of icons. A user can interact with an object by opening a <i>window</i> that displays more information about the object and contains a variety of mechanisms for interacting with the object. A user can also manipulate an object within a window. Icons, windows, and interaction with objects are discussed in more detail in<a href="1.4.3?DT=19921204095534#HDRAICONS"> "Icons" in</a> <a href="1.4.3?DT=19921204095534#HDRAICONS">topic 1.4.3</a>, <a href="1.4.5?DT=19921204095534#HDRWINDOWS">"Windows" in topic 1.4.5</a>, and <a href="1.4.6?DT=19921204095534#HDROBJINT">"Interaction with Objects" in</a><br /><a href="1.4.6?DT=19921204095534#HDROBJINT">topic 1.4.6</a>.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80"><br />The CUA environment includes three types, or classes, of objects:<br /><br />&deg; Container objects<br />&deg; Data objects<br />&deg; Device objects.<br /><br />Each class of objects has a primary purpose that distinguishes it from the other classes, and all three types of objects can contain other objects.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80">The primary purpose of a <i>data</i> <i>object</i> is to convey information, such as text or graphics, or audio or video information. An example of a data object might be a newsletter object, which could contain text objects and graphic objects. Because the primary purpose of each object (text, illustration, and newsletter as a whole) is to convey information of interest to readers, each is considered a data object.<a href="1.1.4.1.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGDATAFIG"> Figure 2</a> shows an example of a data object.<br /><br /><a id="FIGDATAFIG" name="FIGDATAFIG"></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 2.

  <h4>1.1.4.1.3 Device Objects</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A <i>device</i> <i>object</i> often represents a physical object in the real world. For example, a mouse object can represent a user's pointing device, and a modem object can represent a user's modem. Some device objects represent a logical object in a user's computer system rather than a physicalobject. For example, a wastebasket object can represent a logical object that disposes of a user's other objects, and an electronic mail out-basket can represent a logical object that delivers electronic mail to an intended recipient. The primary purpose of a device object is to provide a means of communication between a computer and another physical or logical object.<br /><br />Some device objects can contain other objects. For example, a printer object can contain a queue of objects to be printed, and an electronic mail out-basket object can contain objects to be sent to the user of another computer system. Other device objects simply have settings that a user can configure. Device objects that contain other objects typically act on the contained objects. For example, a printer object will print the objects it contains, and an out-basket object will deliver objects to the intended recipient.<a href="1.1.4.1.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGDEVFIG"> Figure 3</a> shows two device objects.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGDEVFIG" name="FIGDEVFIG"> </a><a href="picture-3?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 3" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P3.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 3.

  <h4>1.1.4.2 Object Hierarchies and
Inheritance</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Objects can be grouped according to similarities in appearance and behavior. These groups can then be arranged into <i>object</i> <i>hierarchies.</i> One relationship that can be illustrated in a hierarchy is <i>inheritance.</i> An object that appears below another object in the hierarchy has all of the characteristics of the object or objects above it. The object is said to "inherit" those characteristics.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGINHIER" name="FIGINHIER"> </a><a href="picture-4?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 4" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P4.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 4. An Object Hierarchy Illustrating Inheritance. Each object that appears below another object in the hierarchy inherits all of the characteristics of the object or objects above it and can add new characteristics of its own.</span><br /><br />In the hierarchy shown in <a href="1.1.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGINHIER">Figure 4</a>, a bar chart inherits all of the characteristics of a chart object, but none of the characteristics unique to a memo. However, a bar chart object and a memo object will have in common those characteristics that each inherited from a data object.<br /><br />Other types of hierarchies are possible. For example, objects can be arranged in a <i>containment</i> hierarchy that illustrates which objects can contain which other objects.<a href="1.1.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGCONHIER"> Figure 5</a> illustrates a possible containment hierarchy.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGCONHIER" name="FIGCONHIER"> </a><a href="picture-5?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 5" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P5.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 5.

  <h3>1.1.5 The Distinctions between
Object-Oriented User Interfaces&nbsp;and&nbsp;Object-Oriented Programming<br />




  </h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Object-oriented user interfaces share some concepts with object-oriented programming. However, the concepts are manifested differently. In an object-oriented user interface, the objects that a user works with do not necessarily correspond to the objects, or modules of code, that a programmer used to create the product. Inheritance and hierarchy in an object-oriented user interface are more subtle than in object-oriented programming. They are based on similarity in appearance and behavior, rather than on superclasses and subclasses of objects. Finally, an object-oriented interface incorporates the concept of containment, which has no parallel concept in object-oriented programming.<br /><br />An important point for a designer to remember is that while object-oriented programming can facilitate the development of an object-oriented user interface, it is not a prerequisite. An object-oriented user interface can be developed with more traditional programming languages and tools.<br /></pre>





  
  
  
  
  <hr />
  
  
  
  
  <h3>1.1.6 Benefits of an
Object-Oriented User Interface</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Users sometimes are intimidated by the technical aspects of an operating system. An object-oriented user interface shields users by allowing them to interact with objects rather than with a distinct operating system and with separate applications that are often incompatible with one another. <br />A user can focus more closely on the task at hand without having to be so conscious of the tools involved. Object orientation reflects the way a person works in the real world. For example, someone writing a memo can concentrate on the message without paying much attention to the tools being used to accomplish the task--pencil and paper in the real world, a memo object in an object-oriented user interface. When working in an object-oriented environment, users can be completely unaware that they are using an editor application to do their writing.<br /><br />Furthermore, a fully object-oriented user interface provides a seamless environment in which a user's interaction with objects is the same across tasks. For example, a user can copy, move, delete, and open all objects the same way, no matter what the user's current task is or which objects are involved. A user could copy a graphic and move it into a cell in a spreadsheet, then place the spreadsheet into a document. Then the user could send the entire resulting object to someone else by placing it into an electronic mail out-basket. Each object is completely compatible with every other object, and objects can be combined and separated freely.<br /><br />Most commercially available graphical user interfaces do not provide fully object-oriented user environments. They still rely on applications--that is, separate programs--many of which are not compatible and thus pose barriers to certain types of user interaction. The CUA user interface encourages full object orientation in user interfaces.<br /></pre>

  <h1>1.2 Chapter 2. Models of a
User Interface<br />



  </h1>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />The term <i>model</i> is used in this book to refer to a descriptive representation of a person's conceptual and operational understanding of something. Some models are explicit and are consciously designed. These models typically can be represented by a diagram or a textual description. Other models, called mental models, are developed unconsciously. People create a mental model by putting together sets of perceived rules and patterns in a way that explains a situation. A typical person cannot draw or describe his or her mental model. In many situations, a person is not aware that the mental model exists.<br /><br />A mental model does not necessarily reflect a situation and its components accurately. Still, a mental model helps people predict what will happen next in a given situation, and it serves as a framework for analysis, understanding, and decision-making.<br /><br />With respect to user interfaces, three models come into play:<br /><br />&deg; A user's conceptual model<br />&deg; A programmer's model<br />&deg; A designer's model.<br /><br />A user's conceptual model is a mental model. A programmer's model and a designer's model are explicit, consciously designed models. Each model represents a different audience's perspective of a user interface. <a href="1.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGMODFIGS">Figure 6</a> illustrates the three audiences and the factors that influence their perspectives.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGMODFIGS" name="FIGMODFIGS"> </a><a href="picture-6?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 6" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P6.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 6.

  <h2>1.2.1 A User's Conceptual Model</h2>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br /><br />A <i>user's</i> <i>conceptual</i> <i>model</i> is a mental model consisting of the set of relationships that a person perceives to exist among elements of any situation. A person develops a conceptual model through experience and then develops expectations based on the relationships in the model.<br /><br />When confronted with a new situation, a person tries to interpret it by comparing it, often unconsciously, to some existing model. For example, if a computer user sees an object on a computer screen, and the object resembles a familiar object, say a telephone, the user transfers concepts from his or her existing model of telephones and makes guesses about how the computer's telephone object might work. Although this might seem to be a hit-or-miss approach to new situations, it is more efficient than building a new model from scratch, and people are satisfied when a new situation fits into their existing models.<br /><br />However, if an existing model does not explain a new situation, and if people are unable to develop a new model, they become uncertain; they proceed hesitantly, and they can become frustrated, perhaps abandoning the new situation entirely because it is too unfamiliar. A user's conceptual model is somewhat resistant to change, but it can change over time as a user collects new evidence that helps a user refine or redefine the model.<br /><br />To understand a user's conceptual model, a designer must understand a user's experiences (such as educational background and job training, as well as previous interaction with machines) and working environment (such as the type of hardware and system software in use). Also, a designer must understand what kinds of information a user needs and what functions a computer system should offer to help a user perform a task.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a designer cannot simply ask all potential users of a product to describe or draw pictures of their conceptual models; most users are unaware that they have a conceptual model. Even users who are aware that they have expectations about a situation typically cannot provide the analytical insight that a designer needs. So a designer must gather information through techniques such as:<br /><br />&deg; Analysis of a users' tasks<br />&deg; Surveys and interviews of actual or potential users<br />&deg; Visits to users' work sites<br />&deg; Feedback from users<br />&deg; Usability testing.<br /><br />Because each user's conceptual model is influenced by different experiences, no two users' conceptual models are exactly alike. Still, these techniques can help a designer compile a fairly complete picture of the conceptual models of a cross-section of users. A designer can then use this information, along with good design judgment and the CUA design principles and guidelines, to make decisions about how to design a product's user interface.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h2><a id="HDRPROGMOD" name="HDRPROGMOD">1.2.2
A
Programmer's
Model</a></h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />A <i>programmer's</i> <i>model</i> represents a product or a computer system from the perspective of the person who writes the code that makes the product or system work. A programmer's model is often very different from both a user's model and a designer's model (described in the next section) because it necessarily includes a more thorough understanding of the computer hardware and supporting software that make a product or system run.<br /><br />A programmer typically could draw a picture of a programmer's model because a programmer's model is more explicit than a user's conceptual model and is consciously created. The programmer's model concentrates primarily on the objects and relationships that the programmer uses to implement a product. For example, a programmer's model might include an object consisting of typed data fields in records in an indexed file. In a user's conceptual model, the same object would simply be an address book. In a designer's model, the concepts would be represented as a group of logically related objects (people's names, addresses, and telephone numbers) that make up an address book object. A programmer requires a level of understanding different from the level required by users.<br />Therefore, although the elements of a programmer's model are vital to the development of a product, a designer should take care to mask the technical details, hiding them from a user without impairing a product's function.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80"><br />A user-interface designer is like an architect. Just as an architect must understand the perspective of the person who is going to live in a house, as well as the perspective of the person who is going to build the house, a user-interface designer must understand the perspectives of the end user and the programmer.<br /><br />A designer's model influences and is influenced by both the user's conceptual model and the programmer's model. There is no direct relationship between the user's conceptual model and the programmer's model.<a href="1.2.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGMODREL"> Figure 7</a> shows how the three models are related.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGMODREL" name="FIGMODREL"> </a><a href="picture-7?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 7" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P7.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 7.

  <h3>1.2.3.1 Object Relationships</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Object relationships are the most important part of a designer's model, and a designer should spend a considerable amount of effort defining them. At this stage of product development, a designer determines what objects a user requires, what the relationships are among the objects, and what properties and behaviors the objects should have. For example, if a designer is developing a model of a product for a car dealership, the designer might determine that a user--in this case a car salesperson--needs a car object and a customer object. The user might<br />also need a worksheet object, in which information from both the car object and customer object can be combined. Finally, the user might need one or more container objects to contain the other objects.<br /><br />When a designer chooses the objects and their properties, behaviors, and relationships carefully, and accurately matches them to the relationships in a user's existing conceptual model, the visual representations and interaction techniques follow naturally.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ2" name="FIGFIGUNIQ2"> </a><a href="picture-9?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 9" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P9.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 9.

  <h3>1.2.3.2 Visual Representations</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A designer's model also addresses the appearance of objects so that a product's objects are visually consistent with one another as well as with other objects in the operating environment. The two aspects to each visual representation in a user interface are the functional aspect and the aesthetic aspect. In designing the functional aspect of a visual representation, a designer is concerned with usability and with how well the visual representation conveys the purpose of the object being represented. In designing the aesthetic aspect of a visual<br />representation, a designer is concerned with whether the representation is visually pleasing. A designer considers factors such as the shape, size, and color of the visual representation.<br /><br />Typically, a designer's model provides a framework for both aspects of the visual representations. The framework includes ways to visually indicate to a user what the purpose or state of an object is, as well as ways to indicate similarity among objects. For a car dealership product, a designer might decide that all cars with prospective buyers should be identified by a similar symbol.<br /><br />Visual specifications assist a designer in maintaining visual consistency, and they provide a foundation on which the designer can build. They also allow a designer leeway in determining which representations are most appropriate for a particular product.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGVISUFG" name="FIGVISUFG"> </a><a href="picture-10?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 10" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P10.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 10.

  <h3>1.2.3.3 Interaction Techniques
and Mechanisms<br />



  </h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Finally, a designer's model addresses a user's techniques for interaction with objects. A typical model includes more than one technique and more than one mechanism for interaction so that users can choose the technique and mechanism that best suits their tasks, their level of skill, and their preferred style of interaction.<br /><br />A designer's model specifies a pattern of interaction in which users interact with similar objects in similar ways and in ways that seem natural to users. Again, consistency should be a designer's goal when developing this part of the designer's model. Toward that end, the CUA interface provides substantial guidance for interaction techniques and mechanisms. When developing a product with a CUA user interface, a designer does not need to develop a complete model of interaction. Instead, a designer's task is to choose from the CUA designer's model (see <a href="1.5?DT=19921204095534#HDRCUADESM">Chapter 5, "The CUA Designer's Model--A Summary" in topic 1.5</a>) those  interaction techniques that are most appropriate for a particular product.<br /><br />In a car dealership product, for example, a designer might determine that a salesperson should be able to place information into a worksheet object in any of several ways. The salesperson could place a car object on top of the worksheet object, thereby transferring information about the car to the worksheet. Or the salesperson could type information directly into the worksheet object. Finally, the salesperson could select portions of information from the car object and copy it to the worksheet object.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGINACTFG" name="FIGINACTFG"> </a><a href="picture-11?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 11" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P11.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 11.

Accommodating the
Differences between a&nbsp;User's Conceptual Model and a Designer's
Model</a><br />



  </h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />Ideally, a designer's model is equivalent to a user's conceptual model, and a product works the way each user expects it to work. However, various factors can lead to a disparity between a user's conceptual model and a designer's model. For example:<br /><br />&deg; Not all users have the same conceptual models.<br /><br />&deg; Implementation constraints can restrict the function of a product to something less than a user expects.<br /><br />&deg; A computer product can provide useful features that do not have corresponding components in the real world or in a user's area of expertise, and therefore do not already exist in a user's conceptual model.<br /><br />When a designer's model does not exactly match a user's conceptual model, the user often feels as if he or she is viewing a product through a haze, not quite seeing or understanding the product. Some components of the product look and behave as the user expects, while others seem somewhat different or even foreign. To dispel the haze, a designer should expose a user to the features of a product in a way that helps shape the user's conceptual model to incorporate the actual designer's model. Then the two become equivalent.<br /><br />Consistency and the use of metaphors are helpful techniques for shaping a user's conceptual model. When a new feature is consistent with a product's other features, a user can predict at least some of the results of using the new feature and can accept the new feature more readily. Likewise, when a new feature is developed around a metaphor for something that exists in a user's conceptual model, a user can make guesses about the new feature by drawing analogies from the familiar concept. The user can then extend the existing conceptual model to incorporate the new feature. Electronic mail provides an example.<br /><br />Although most people understand how to mail a letter by using a postal or courier service, few immediately understand how to send information by pressing a key on a keyboard or by placing a computer object on top of another computer object (for example, placing a document object on top of an out-basket object). By designing this type of information transfer around a mail metaphor, a designer encourages a user to draw on an existing conceptual model that describes and explains methods for getting information from one place to another. Furthermore, if a designer has specified an interaction technique that is consistent with other interaction techniques that a user is familiar with, a user will be able to extend a conceptual model of mail to include electronic mail. For example, if a user knows how to mail a real-world document by placing it into the office out-basket, the user can easily learn to mail a document object by placing it into an out-basket object on a computer.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGMAILMET" name="FIGMAILMET"> </a><a href="picture-12?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 12" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P12.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 12. Metaphor. Electronic mail relies on a mail metaphor to help users understand the underlying concept of electronic transfer of information. To mail document objects, users place them into an out-basket object, just as users place real-world documents into real-world out-baskets.</span><br /><br />A designer's model must also be flexible enough to accommodate growing sophistication in users. As users become more proficient in using a product, they might find that they do not like certain aspects of the interface, or they might realize that they want or need functions that they had not thought of before. A successful designer anticipates a user's progress and provides mechanisms that are robust enough to stretch as novice users become expert users. For example, when working with a printer object, a typical user wants information about which objects are in the printer's queue, as well as the orientation and number of copies the printer will produce. This information should be readily available.<br />However, a more sophisticated user might want information about the printer's connections, baud rate, and communication protocol. This information should also be available, but it should not get in the way of the information needed by a typical user.<br /><br />By layering information, a designer can keep a product's interface free of clutter and can avoid intimidating novice users while still meeting the needs of expert users. Chapters 3 and 4 provide information about the design principles and interface components that enable designers to create products that serve users' needs.<br /></pre>

  <h2>1.2.5 Accommodating the
Programmer's Model in the Designer's
Model<br />



  </h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />Ideally, a designer should create a model appropriate for users, and a programmer should write programming code that supports the designer's entire model. However, a designer must sometimes make concessions to the restrictions of a programming environment. For example, in a product that offers an electronic mail feature, a designer might specify that a user should receive some kind of immediate notification when mail reaches its intended recipient. But if the network that the mail travels on is subject to unpredictable delays, the designer might have to settle for a notification that arrives as soon as the network allows, rather than an immediate notification. The designer might also have to add a feature<br />that lets a user know where a piece of mail is while in route.<br /><br />When accommodating a programmer's model in a designer's model, a designer should be certain to shield users from complex details of a product's implementation. As shown in <a href="1.2.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGMODREL">Figure 7 in topic 1.2.3</a>, there should be no direct relationship between a programmer's model and a user's conceptual model. Any aspect of a programmer's model that must be exposed to a user must first be filtered through the designer's model. For example, a typical user expects that the information displayed in a window is up to date. The user's expectation should be reflected in the designer's model. However, a programmer cannot always ensure that displayed information is up to date; perhaps a network delay interferes. To bridge the gap between a user's expectations and what a programmer can deliver, a designer's model can include a way for a user to manually refresh the display of information.<br /><br />Just as an architect must know the strengths and weaknesses of building materials and the skills of the builders contracted to construct a house, a designer must be aware of the capabilities and limitations of the programming environment, and the skills of the programmers who will implement the design.<br /></pre>

Goals and

  <pre width="80">The primary goal of the CUA user interface is to help a user to transfer knowledge across products. If a user learns to use one product that has a CUA interface, the user can quickly learn to use any other product that has a CUA interface. Additional goals of the CUA user interface are to:<br /><br />&deg; Increase a user's productivity<br />&deg; Increase a user's satisfaction with a product<br />&deg; Reduce a user's error rate.<br /><br />The CUA user interface achieves these goals by adhering to the design principles discussed in this chapter. The design principles are based on principles of human behavior, field experience, and results of usability testing.<br /><br />Occasionally a designer must choose between two design principles if both pertain to a particular aspect of the user interface. Sometimes factors outside a designer's control can lead a designer to favor one principle at the expense of another. For example, cost, performance, and usability concerns sometimes conflict. A designer must balance them according to their effect on a user and a user's tasks. Above all, a designer must keep a user in mind when creating a user interface.<br /><br />The design principles are grouped according to these categories:<br /><br />&deg; Placing a user in control of the user interface<br />&deg; Reducing a user's memory load<br />&deg; Making the user interface consistent.<br /><br />If a designer conscientiously combines these design principles with knowledge of a product's intended users and with usability testing, the resulting product should be easy to learn and easy to use.</pre>

  <h2>1.3.1 Design Principles That
Place a User in Control</h2>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />A user should always be able to communicate with a computer and should never feel that the computer is in control. Whenever possible, a designer should avoid program-driven sequences that prompt a user through fixed steps and directive messages. Program-driven interaction is like riding a train: a user must go where the program goes, according to its schedule. A designer should aim for user-driven interaction, which is like driving a car: a user goes where the user wants, according to the user's schedule. A product should allow a user alternative courses of action and should not limit a user's capabilities by imposing a designer's or programmer's preconceived notions of the "correct" sequence for accomplishing a task.<br /><br />In general, a designer should approach product design with a "no user errors" philosophy. That is, a product should never make users feel that they are in the wrong--rather, users should feel that any shortcomings are in the product, not in themselves.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.1.2 Displaying Descriptive
and Helpful Messages</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Chances are that at some point a user will interact with a product in a way that the product's designer did not anticipate. When that happens, the product should indicate to the user that it cannot interpret the user's action. Typically a product would display some kind of message, although in some situations an audible cue or a graphical cue would suffice.<br /><br />Because a situation in which a message is displayed is often a situation in which a user needs the most support, messages should be clear and concise and should provide mechanisms for user interaction. A message should describe the situation objectively, without placing blame, and should help a user correct the situation. For example, if a user inserts a diskette that has not been formatted, and the user tries to save an object to that diskette, the product should display a message that tells the user that the diskette has not been formatted. The message should include mechanisms that allow the user to format the diskette and save the<br />object without having to leave the message window. The message should also include mechanisms that allow the user to take other courses of action.<a href="1.3.1.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGMESSFIG"> Figure 14</a> shows an example of an appropriate message.<br /><br /><a id="FIGMESSFIG" name="FIGMESSFIG"> </a><a href="picture-14?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 14" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P14.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 14.

Using
Modes
Judiciously</a></h3>





  

  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A <i>mode</i> is a state of a product in which only certain actions are available to a user. That is, modes restrict a user's options. However, modes can be useful in some situations. For example, they can extend the capabilities of input devices by allowing several actions to be accomplished with the same technique, key, button, and so forth. Modes can also help an expert user perform a series of actions very quickly.<br /><br />A mode limits a product's response to a user's actions. For example, if a user were typing a report using a product that has a typing mode and a line-drawing mode, the user would have to leave the typing mode to draw lines around a paragraph. Because typing would be an action unavailable in the line-drawing mode, the user would have to switch modes again to continue typing the report.<br /><br />Modes can be useful in directing a user's interaction with a product. However, designers have historically overused modes without regard for how modes affect users. Users can feel powerless when a mode restricts their actions.<br /><br />One drawback of modes is that the same action can produce a different result, or no result, in a different mode. For example, in a typical typing mode, a letter appears when a user presses a character key. In a line-drawing mode, perhaps only the cursor-movement keys have any effect; pressing a character key might produce no result.<br /><br />Another drawback to modes is that users tend to forget which mode they are in unless a product clearly indicates the current mode. A user can be puzzled when an action leads to an unintended result. For example, pressing the right arrow key in a typing mode typically moves the cursor to the right. In a line-drawing mode, perhaps the right arrow key extends a horizontal line by some increment. If a user presses the right arrow key intending to edit some text, and instead draws a longer line, the user can be surprised, confused, or even exasperated.<br /><br />To alleviate some of the problems associated with modes, a designer should try to use only those modes that require an ongoing user action, such as pressing a mouse button or a keyboard key, to maintain the mode. Also, a designer should specify some kind of mode indicator. For example, a pointer or cursor could have one visual representation when the user is in a text-editing mode and another when the user is in a line-drawing mode. <a href="1.3.1.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGMODEIND">Figure 13</a> shows examples of pointers used as mode indicators.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGMODEIND" name="FIGMODEIND"> </a><a href="picture-13?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 13" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P13.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 13. Mode Indicators. When a user is in text editing mode, for example, the pointer can change to an I-beam pointer to indicate the mode. When the user changes to line-drawing mode, the pointer can change to a cross-hair pointer.</span><br /><br />If a designer finds it necessary to use a mode for a particular part of a product, the designer should keep the scope of the mode narrow and should allow a user to continue to interact with other parts of the product while the mode is in effect. For example, if a product requires more information from a user and displays a message window to elicit the information, the user should still be able to scroll the underlying window and interact with other parts of the window not affected by the lack of information. The user should also be able to interact with other objects.<br /><br />In general, a designer should use modes with caution and should make them obvious and easy to get out of.<br /></pre>

  </h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">The results of a user's actions should be obvious immediately. Immediate feedback allows a user to assess whether the results were as expected. If the results are not as expected, the user can choose an alternative action right away. For example, when a user selects a choice to change the font of some selected text, the appearance of the selected text should change immediately. The user can then decide if the resulting effect is desirable and can select another choice if it is not.<br /><br />If the results of a user's actions cannot be made obvious immediately--for example, if a network delay interferes--a product should still provide some kind of feedback. For example, the product should indicate to the user that the action is being processed. However, a designer should make sure that a product's feedback does not interrupt a user's work.<br /><br />The results of a user's actions should also be reversible. By providing reversible actions, a designer allows a user to learn by exploring, to try an action to see the result, and to undo the action if the result is not what was expected or desired. For example, if a user types a word and then decides a different word would be better, the user can press the Backspace key to undo the original typing. Likewise, a user should be able to redo any action that has been undone. A user feels more comfortable with an interface in which an action does not cause irreversible consequences.<br /><br />If an action cannot be made reversible, a product should inform a user and should give the user an opportunity to select some other action. A product might display a message that tells what the outcome of a user's action will be and that indicates alternative actions for the user to select from. For example, if a user attempts to erase a diskette, the product should display a message that tells the user that if the action continues, the user will no longer be able to retrieve the information on the diskette. The message should also indicate alternative actions that the user can take, such as stopping the action or replacing the diskette in question with another diskette.<br /><br />A designer is responsible for determining which actions can be undone and which cannot, but the designer should always keep users' needs in mind and should err on the side of more reversible actions rather than fewer reversible actions. A designer also determines how many actions in a series of actions can be undone.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.1.4 Accommodating Users
with Different Levels of Skill</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Much of user interface design is focused on novice or casual users. However, many products offer features for more expert users as well. When designing a user interface, a designer should provide a way for a user to proceed at a comfortable pace, learning as much as necessary to accomplish the task at hand. A designer should also provide a way for a user to go beyond the basic level of knowledge required for frequently used features. A product should encourage exploration so that, as a user's expertise increases, the user is able to discover and use the product's more advanced features.<br /><br />For example, a product might initially display simplified menus containing only those choices that a novice or casual user would use. However, the product could also contain a mechanism that allows experienced or expert users to display complete menus of all of the product's choices.<br /><br />A novice or casual user requires different kinds of support than those required by a frequent or expert user. To accommodate a novice or casual user, a designer should rely heavily on visual cues and should avoid making a user type extensively or remember details. Another technique is to provide abbreviated menus and simplified windows. To accommodate a frequent or expert user, a designer can provide hidden mechanisms, such as shortcut keys, and condensed sequences of steps. A designer can also provide a way to remove some visual cues. For example, an expert user should be able to turn off the display of certain kinds of information that he or she does not require.<br /><br />Users at any level of knowledge and experience can benefit from help information that describes a product's objects, choices, and interaction techniques, and offers a user assistance in completing a task. A novice or casual user might require extensive help information about each component of a product's interface, while a frequent or expert user might require only a brief description.<br /><br />In general, an interface should be flexible enough to accommodate a full range of users, but a designer should make sure that the interface serves the needs of the primary users.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.1.5 Making the User
Interface Transparent</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A user interface provides tools that help a user accomplish a task; therefore, an interface should focus a user's attention on the task or end product. Just as a chef is only incidentally interested in the tools of the cooking trade--pots, pans, and ovens--and prefers to concentrate on the finished meal, a user is only incidentally interested in the tools provided by a user interface--menus, pointers, keyboards, icons, and windows. A user prefers to concentrate on conveying ideas, calculating a return on investment, or replenishing an inventory, for example, and a designer should make sure that the tools provided by a user interface do not get in the user's way. A good user interface requires little conscious thought on a user's part.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.1.6 Allowing a User to
Customize the User Interface</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Because they have varying backgrounds, interests, motivations, and experiences, no two users are exactly alike. To accommodate individual differences, a designer should create a flexible interface that each user can customize according to personal preference. A user should be able to customize the volume and duration of sounds, the intensity and hue of colors, the arrangement of choices in menus, the sequence of steps in a process, and any other aspect of the user interface. A designer should never underestimate a user's creativity or desire for imprinting personal style on a computer.<br /><br />A designer should also recognize that different users have different physical characteristics and work in diverse environments. One user might want to increase the volume of audible cues on a system to compensate for hearing loss or for a noisy work environment. Another user might want to enlarge the visual representations of the interface's components to compensate for impaired vision or inadequate lighting. Allowing a user to completely customize a user interface can lead to higher productivity and higher user satisfaction. However, a designer should provide defaults that are satisfactory to most users and that a user can revert to.<br /></pre>

  <h2 style="width: 640px;">1.3.2 Design Principles That
Reduce a User's Memory Load</h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A user should never have to rely on memory for something a product can "remember." Because people are better at recognition than at recall, a product should present alternatives and let a user choose from among them. For example, a product could provide lists of items, such as choices in a menu. A user can recognize choices in a menu without having to recall commands or their syntax.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ3" name="FIGFIGUNIQ3"> </a><a href="picture-15?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 15" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P15.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 15. Recall versus Recognition. The window on the left offers few cues to a user, who must remember a set of commands and syntax. The window on the right presents a user with a menu, a list of items that a user can recognize and point to.</span><br /><br />A product should also provide reminders to help a user keep track of the task at hand. For example, a product could provide visual cues, such as highlighting or progress indicators, or textual cues, such as status messages. Highlighting can remind a user that an object is selected, and a progress indicator can remind a user that a process is under way.<br /><br />Another way to avoid overloading a user's memory is to provide default settings and to save previously selected settings. The window in which the settings are saved can also remind a user about which settings are in effect. For example, a user might want to change the colors that appear on a screen. After experimenting with various colors, the user might settle on a particular combination and save those settings. At a later date, however, the user might decide to revert to the original colors. By providing a default setting for screen colors, the product relieves the user of the responsibility for remembering the original colors.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.2.1 Defining Meaningful
and Concise Object Classes</h3>





  

  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">In both the real world and in an object-oriented user interface, certain objects are better suited to certain tasks. For example, a telephone serves a person's needs for oral communication better than a typewriter does, while a person would be hard pressed to write a report with a telephone. When designing objects for an object-oriented user interface, a designer should consider the tasks a user will want to accomplish and then should ensure that the characteristics of the objects support the user's tasks.<br /><br />A designer should clearly define the properties of each object and should establish a hierarchy of object classes based on these properties. The objects should be designed so that a user can easily recognize members of a class and can understand what distinguishes one class of objects from another. The distinctions among classes should be meaningful to a user and should not be based on underlying programming distinctions or requirements. For example, a product might contain a chart object and a parts catalog object. When a user works with a chart object, the user develops a body of knowledge about that object and comes to expect that other chart objects share certain characteristics and behave similarly. Likewise, a user develops a different set of expectations about a parts catalog object because it behaves differently from a chart object. From a<br />user's perspective, these two objects have different purposes--that is, they belong to different object classes--even though they share some behaviors, such as opening and closing. A user does not care, and does not need to know, that to a programmer or a designer both objects are members of the data object class.<br /><br />An object hierarchy should be concise. So should the visual representations of the objects in the hierarchy. Typically, each object in a class of objects is represented by the same type of icon. The individual objects are distinguished by different icon labels, which indicate the name of each object. If a user interface is cluttered with too many types of objects or too many types of icons, a user can become overwhelmed. To keep a user focused on the right objects, a designer should keep the number of object classes to a minimum while still allowing a user to accomplish a task without undue effort. If a product seems to<br />require a new object class, a designer should first consider modifying an existing class. Likewise, a designer should consider modifying existing icons to represent new object classes. However, a designer should be sure that the visual distinctions among icons are obvious enough for a user to discern them readily. Reuse of an existing class allows a user to draw on previous knowledge of the class and decreases learning time. <br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.2.2 Making Objects
Concrete and Recognizable</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">When a computer object resembles a real-world object in appearance or behavior, or both, a user can transfer knowledge about the real-world object to the computer environment. By including familiar objects in a product, a designer can help users learn to use the product more quickly.<br /><br />The visible representation of computer objects should be easily recognizable, and a computer object should resemble its real-world counterpart when possible. For example, in a car dealership product, an object that represents the general information about a car should resemble the general information found on the car's window sticker.<a href="1.3.2.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGSTIKFIG"> Figure 16</a> shows an example of a recognizable object.<br /><br /><a id="FIGSTIKFIG" name="FIGSTIKFIG"> </a><a href="picture-16?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 16" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P16.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 16. Concrete, Recognizable Objects. The car object's icon resembles a real car, and the information in the window resembles the information found on the sticker on a car window.</span><br /><br />When an object represents a more abstract notion that does not have a real-world counterpart, the representation of the object should still help a user visualize and remember relationships.<br /></pre>

  <h2>1.3.3 Design Principles That
Contribute to Consistency</h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Consistency helps a user transfer knowledge from one product to another and helps a user predict how something new will work. To create a consistent user interface, a designer should develop paradigms that provide for identical implementation of common functions throughout a product. For example, the CUA guidelines specify that a user should be able to use the same technique for editing text, regardless of where the text appears.<br /><br />For any single design decision, a designer must consider whether being consistent with respect to one component of an interface can affect the consistency of other components. Some components of a user interface might be consistent in shape, location, or color. Others might be consistent in interaction techniques. A designer should make sure that components are consistent in the ways that a user would expect.<br /><br />A designer must also remember that consistency is a means to an end--ease of learning and reduction of errors--rather than an end itself. Sometimes it is impractical or impossible to be completely consistent. In that case, a designer must make consistency compromises based on knowledge of a user's conceptual model and should be consistent in whichever way seems more natural to a user.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.3.1 Sustaining the Context
of a User's Task</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Users can become confused if everything in front of them changes continuously, without apparent cause, while they work. To reassure a user and give a user a sense of continuity, a product should provide cues that help a user relate an effect to its cause.<br /><br />A product should also maintain useful points of reference while a user works on a task. For example, when a user adds objects to a folder, the appearance of the folder's window should remain the same while the appearance of the window's contents changes.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ4" name="FIGFIGUNIQ4"> </a><a href="picture-17?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 17" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P17.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 17. Sustaining the Context of a User's Task. The window on the left shows that the container contains two objects. When a user adds more objects to the container, the appearance of the window remains the same while the appearance of the window's contents changes.</span><br /><br />Additionally, a user should be able to complete a step or a series of related steps without having to alternate between input devices. For example, a user should not have to use a pointing device to scroll text while editing that text from the keyboard. The text should scroll automatically when the cursor reaches the boundary of the area the user is working in, and the keyboard should have its own scrolling mechanisms, such as keys that move text up or down in the window, either a line at a time or a screenful at a time.<br /><br />Finally, a user should be able to predict the result of an action. Two ways in which a designer can help a user predict a result are to provide consistent responses to actions and to provide actions appropriate to a user's tasks. A designer determines appropriate actions and responses by using task analysis and by relying on metaphors when suitable metaphors can be found. Also, by labeling actions with appropriate terms, a designer helps a user develop expectations about the outcome of those actions.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.3.2 Maintaining Continuity
within and among Products</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A designer should not discount a user's experiences with other user interfaces, such as those provided in prior versions of a product, or those generally accepted as industry standards. Instead, a new product or a new version of an existing product should build on a user's knowledge. Therefore, a designer should be cautious in changing the behavior of an object from one version of a product to the next. A designer must test a new behavior to make sure that its benefits outweigh the drawbacks of forcing a user to relearn the object's behavior. One way to accommodate both new users and experienced users is to provide both the old and the new behavior for an object and let the users choose which to use.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.3.3 Creating Aesthetic
Appeal</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">The appearance of a product's interface can significantly affect a user's attitude toward the interface. Inconsistent design and haphazard placement of objects can confuse a user and can contribute to a user's dissatisfaction with a product.<br /><br />When designing the appearance of a user interface, a designer should adhere to generally accepted practices for information presentation. By skillfully using white space, color, proximity, overlap, size and shape differences, and other components of visual communication, a designer can make an interface more efficient and effective and can increase a user's satisfaction with a product.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.3.3.4 Using Visual Metaphors</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">To draw on a user's existing conceptual model, a designer should include elements that are familiar to a user. One way a designer can make an interface seem familiar is to use metaphors. For example, a designer could use a folder icon, which is a visual metaphor for a manila folder, an object familiar to a user. The folder is also a metaphor for the familiar concept of storage. In a computer environment, storage might be accomplished differently from what a user is accustomed to, but the metaphoric representations help a user draw on existing knowledge. Metaphors also help set the stage for expanding a user's conceptual model to accommodate the additional capabilities provided by the computer.<br /><br /><a id="FIGINIT" name="FIGINIT"> </a><a href="picture-18?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 18" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P18.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 18.

For example, the icon for a printer can change to indicate that the printer has run out of paper.<br /><br />An icon doesn't have to be a static image.

The
Pointer</a></h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Typically only one pointer appears on the workplace at a time, and it is associated with a user's pointing device, such as a mouse, trackball, or joystick. When a user moves the pointing device, the pointer moves correspondingly, and when a user presses a button on the pointing device, the object that the pointer is on is affected.<br /><br />The pointing device used most often in a CUA environment is a two-button mouse. One of the two mouse buttons is called the <i>selection</i> <i>button</i> (see  <a href="1.4.6.4?DT=19921204095534#HDRSELECTN">"Selection" in topic 1.4.6.4</a>). The other mouse button is called the  <i>manipulation</i> <i>button,</i> and it is used for direct manipulation (see  <a href="1.4.6?DT=19921204095534#HDROBJINT">"Interaction with Objects" in topic 1.4.6</a>). A user can choose either the  left or right mouse button for either function, selection or manipulation. If a three-button mouse is used, the third button is called the menu button.<br /><br />The CUA pointer is usually shaped like an arrow. However, the shape of the pointer can change to indicate what kinds of actions are possible. For example, the pointer is shaped like an I-beam when it is over text that can be edited or over an area into which text can be placed. Products can provide product-specific pointers that serve the special needs of their audiences. For example, a graphics product might provide a special pointer to help a user draw lines accurately. However, before providing a new pointer, a designer should first consider modifying an existing pointer so that a user can transfer knowledge about the existing pointer rather than having to learn about a new one.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ7" name="FIGFIGUNIQ7"> </a><a href="picture-22?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 22" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P22.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 22.

  <h3>1.4.4.2 The Cursor</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Typically only one cursor appears on the workplace at a time, and it is associated with a user's keyboard. When a user presses a key, information is transmitted to the operating system, and if appropriate, something appears or occurs at the cursor's position.<br /><br />The CUA cursors are the <i>selection</i> <i>cursor</i> and the <i>text</i> <i>cursor.</i> The selection cursor is used to indicate which items a user can interact with from the keyboard. For example, a selection cursor can indicate which items can be selected or which items can display a pop-up menu (see <a href="1.4.6.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRCONMENU">"Pop-up Menus" in topic 1.4.6.2</a>).

  <pre width="80">A <i>window</i> is a part of the CUA interface through which a user can view an object. A window is bounded by a window <i>border,</i> which separates the window from other windows on the workplace. Within the border are mechanisms that allow a user to manipulate the window and its contents.<br /><br /><a id="FIGWINFIG" name="FIGWINFIG"> </a><a href="picture-27?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 27" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P27.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 27.

The system menu symbol, the window border, and the window sizing buttons allow a user to change the size and position of a window. The menu bar and scroll bars allow a user to work with the window's contents. The window title indicates the name of the object seen in the window, and it also indicates which kind of view (see <a href="1.4.5.1?DT=19921204095534#HDRVIEWS">"Views" in topic 1.4.5.1</a>) is displayed. The information area displays brief messages to a user about the object or choice that the cursor is on. Information about the normal completion of a process can also appear in the information area. For example, if a user copies several objects from one container to another, the information area in a container's window could display a brief message to tell the user when the copying has been completed.<br /><br />A window and its content--that is, the information below the menu bar and above the horizontal scroll bar--are not permanently tied together. A user can completely change the content of a window without opening a new window. For example, a user can change the view (see <a href="1.4.5.1?DT=19921204095534#HDRVIEWS">"Views" in</a><a href="1.4.5.1?DT=19921204095534#HDRVIEWS"> </a><a href="1.4.5.1?DT=19921204095534#HDRVIEWS">topic 1.4.5.1</a>) of the object displayed in the window.

  <pre width="80">The content of a window is a <i>view.</i> A view is a way of looking at an object's information. Different views display information in different forms, which mimics the way information about an object is presented in the real world. Consider, for example, a user's manual for a personal computer system. A user's manual typically describes a computer system in several different ways. It provides:<br /><br />&deg; A picture of the entire system with each piece correctly set up<br />&deg; A picture of each piece of the system<br />&deg; A list of the pieces of the system, such as the display screen, keyboard, pointing device, and printer<br />&deg; A list of the features of the system, such as the processing speed and memory capacity<br />&deg; Step-by-step directions for setting up the system and for using each piece of the system.<br /><br />Each of these ways of looking at or describing the computer system is a view of the system.<br /><br />The CUA interface also provides different kinds of views for objects in the CUA environment. The appearance of a window's contents and the kinds of interaction possible in a window are determined, in part, by the type of view presented in the window. The four basic types of views are:<br /><br />&deg; Composed view<br />&deg; Contents view<br />&deg; Settings view<br />&deg; Help view.<br /><br />An object can have more than one view. In fact, most objects have several types of views.<br /><br />To determine which types of views an object should have, a designer needs to consider which kinds of data an object contains. Some kinds of data have linear (or string-like) characteristics. For example, text can be thought of as a linear sequence of characters. An audio waveform is also linear, and so is a musical score. Other kinds of data have tabular (or array-like) characteristics. For example, a spreadsheet or text arranged in columns and rows is tabular. Still other kinds of data have neither linear nor tabular characteristics. Graphics and graphical components of an interface can be placed in various relative positions and still have meaning. They are said to have free-form characteristics.<br /><br />A particular object can contain data that has one or more of these types of characteristics, but each characteristic might be displayed best in a different type of view. For each object, a designer should provide views that allow a user to display and work easily with each type of data contained in the object. When a user makes a change to the data displayed in one view of an object, the change should be reflected immediately in all other views of the same object (if the user has chosen to have the other views refreshed automatically).<br /><br /><a id="FIGVWFIG" name="FIGVWFIG"> </a><a href="picture-29?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 29" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P29.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 29.

Designers should keep in mind that these four types of views represent idealized views along a continuum of possible views. A designer can create product-specific views that fall somewhere between these categories. A designer should provide an appropriate name, based on the users' conceptual model, for each view in a product.<br /></pre>

  <h4>1.4.5.1.2 Contents Views</h4>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A <i>contents</i> <i>view</i> lists the components of an object. The components can be ordered or unordered in the view; the order of the information displayed in a contents view does not affect the meaning of the object containing the information. For example, the data on which a graph object or chart object is based could be displayed as an alphabetic, numeric, or random list in a contents view. The data is still the same, no matter the order in which it is listed. Container objects in particular are likely to be displayed in a contents view, although data objects and device objects can also be displayed in a contents view.<a href="1.4.5.1.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGCONTVW"> Figure 31</a> illustrates a contents view.<br /><br /><a id="FIGCONTVW" name="FIGCONTVW"> </a><a href="picture-31?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 31" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P31.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 31. A Contents View. A contents view of a data object lists the data contained in the object. The order of the data does not affect the meaning of the object in a contents view.</span><br /><br />The CUA interface provides for two standard kinds of contents views:<br /><br />&deg; Icons view<br />&deg; Details view.<br /><br />A designer can provide other product-specific kinds of contents views, depending on a user's needs. However, if a product includes objects that contain other objects, the product should provide at least the two standard kinds of contents views.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Icons</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">View</i>: An <i>icons</i> <i>view</i> displays each object as an icon and is appropriate when a designer wants to give a user an easy way to change the position of objects or to otherwise directly manipulate them (see <a href="1.4.6?DT=19921204095534#HDROBJINT">"Interaction with Objects" in topic 1.4.6</a>). From a user's perspective, an icon is the object itself. From a designer's perspective, an icon is a composed view of an object. Note, however, that an icons view is a contents view. <a href="1.4.5.1.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGCONTFIG">Figure 32</a> shows an icons view of a folder object that contains several documents.<br /><br /><a id="FIGCONTFIG" name="FIGCONTFIG"> </a><a href="picture-32?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 32" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P32.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 32. An Icons View of an Opened Folder. This view of the contents of a folder displays an icon for each contained object.</span><br /><br /><b>Reflections</b>: An object usually is represented by only one icon. However, for some tasks, a user might find it convenient to represent an object with more than one icon. For example, a user might want a representation of a printer object in more than one place so that the user could have easy access to the printer from whichever folder or work area the user is working in. A user can create an additional icon, known as a <i>reflection</i>, to represent the same printer object.<br /><br />Each reflection of a single object is related to the other reflections in such a way that when a user changes an object by way of one reflection, the change is reflected in all other reflections of the same object. However, if a user deletes a reflection, other reflections of the same object are not necessarily deleted. A user can choose to delete individual reflections or can delete all reflections of an object at once, at the user's discretion.<br /><br />For related information, see <a href="1.4.3?DT=19921204095534#HDRAICONS">"Icons" in topic 1.4.3</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Details View</span>: A <i>details</i> <i>view</i> combines small icons with text that provides additional information about objects.

  <pre width="80">A <i>composed</i> <i>view</i> presents the components of an object in relative order and is appropriate when the relationships among the components contribute to the overall meaning of the object. Data objects in particular are likely to be displayed in a composed view. For example, a graph object or chart object would typically be displayed in a composed view because the arrangement of the components determines the meaning of the object as a whole. If the arrangement of the components changes, the meaning of the object changes.<a href="1.4.5.1.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGCOMPFIG"> Figure 30</a> shows an example of a composed view.<br /><br /><a id="FIGCOMPFIG" name="FIGCOMPFIG"> </a><a href="picture-30?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 30" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P30.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 30.

  <h4>1.4.5.1.3 Settings Views</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A <i>settings</i> <i>view</i> displays information about the characteristics, attributes, or properties of an object, and it provides a way for a user to change the settings of some characteristics or properties. Not all settings can be changed, however. For example, a user cannot change an object's creation date even though the date might be displayed in a settings view of the object.<br /><br />A settings view typically is provided for each type of object. In a settings view for a data object such as a document, a user could change the font, type size, color, or whatever other settings are appropriate for the document. In a settings view for a device object such as a printer, a user could change the number of copies, the page orientation, the output destination, or whatever other settings are appropriate for the printer.<br /><br />Settings views can be applied more broadly as well. For example, certain kinds of information about an object can be thought of as settings. An address book object might contain objects representing the people that a user writes to, and the settings for each of these objects might consist of the person's name and address. <a href="1.4.5.1.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGSETFIG">Figure 34</a> shows an example of a settings view.<br /><br /><a id="FIGSETFIG" name="FIGSETFIG"> </a><a href="picture-34?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 34" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P34.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 34.

  <h4>1.4.5.1.5 Distinguishing a
Composed View from a Contents
View</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">From a designer's perspective, the distinction between a composed view and a contents view can be somewhat blurred, depending on the object being viewed. For example, a product might provide a kind of view that lists the sections of a document, much as an outline does. Lists of an object's components are characteristic of a contents view. However, the product's view might list the sections of the document in a meaningful order, which is characteristic of a composed view.<br /><br />Designers should not be overly concerned about which category a particular view falls into. Instead, designers should create views that convey information in a form that is meaningful to users, regardless of where the views fall in the continuum of view types. The names that designers choose for the views should describe the information displayed and should be easily understood by users. For example, a product could provide a "Formatted Text" view or a "Page Layout" view as the composed view of a document. The product could also provide an "Outline" view as either a composed view or a contents view of a document.<br /></pre>

Interaction with
Objects</a></h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Natural languages typically have many more nouns than verbs, and a graphical user interface typically contains more objects than actions. Just as the same verb can be applied to many nouns, the same action can be applied to many objects. The <i>object-action</i> <i>paradigm</i> is a pattern for interaction in which a user first selects an object, then selects an action. When a user selects an object first, the system can then present a list of actions that can be applied to that object; the user does not have to remember which actions are available. The object-action paradigm is really a continuum, with <i>direct</i> <i>manipulation</i> at one end and <i>indirect</i><br /><i>manipulation</i> at the other.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ11" name="FIGFIGUNIQ11"> </a><a href="picture-36?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 36" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P36.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 36. The Object-Action Continuum. At one end of the continuum is direct manipulation, in which an object and an action are closely bound. At the other end is indirect manipulation, in which a user selects an object, then selects an action. Between the two extremes are other manipulation techniques, such as drag and drop, pop-up menus, and menu bars.</span><br /><br />Direct manipulation is interaction with an object by way of a pointing device. This interaction technique closely resembles the way a user interacts with objects in the real world. For example, using direct manipulation a user can "pick up" an object and put it into a folder. During direct manipulation, an object and an action are bound together closely.<br /><br />Indirect manipulation is interaction with an object through choices and controls (see <a href="1.4.6.3.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRACTRL">"Controls" in topic 1.4.6.3.2</a>). Indirect manipulation can be accomplished with either a pointing device or a keyboard. During indirect manipulation, an object and an action are separated. A user selects an object first, then the interface immediately tailors and presents a list of appropriate actions, which are displayed as choices that the user can apply to that object. The product, rather than the user, stores the information that tells a user which actions can be applied to the selected object. Users who interact with a computer by using a keyboard exclusively can use indirect manipulation to obtain results equivalent to those available through the use of direct manipulation.<br /><br />Other manipulation techniques can fall between the two extremes. For example, using a <i>pop-up</i> <i>menu</i> (see <a href="1.4.6.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRCONMENU">"Pop-up Menus" in topic 1.4.6.2</a>) is more direct than using other kinds of menus, but it is less direct than dragging an object.<br /><br />The following sections provide details about techniques and components used for interaction with objects.<br /><br /></pre>

  <pre width="80"><i>Drag</i> <i>and</i> <i>drop</i> is an interaction technique that falls at the direct manipulation end of the object-action continuum. It is called <i>drag</i> <i>and</i> <i>drop</i> because it involves moving an object from one place (dragging) and leaving it at another (dropping). For example, to change a value represented by a bar on a bar chart, a user could drag the end of a bar until the bar represented an appropriate new value. The user would then drop the end of the bar in the new location to complete the direct manipulation.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ12" name="FIGFIGUNIQ12"> </a><a href="picture-37?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 37" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P37.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 37. Direct Manipulation in a Bar Chart View of a Document Object. By dragging a bar, a user can change the value the bar represents.</span><br /><br />Drag and drop often involves a <i>source</i> <i>object</i> and a <i>target</i> <i>object.</i> A source object is usually the object a user is working with, and a target object is usually an object that a user is transferring information to. For example, if a user drags a spreadsheet object to a printer object so that the spreadsheet will be printed, the spreadsheet is the source object and the printer is the target object.<br /><br />The result of drag and drop can change depending on what the source object is and what the target object is. For example, if a user drags a spreadsheet object from one folder object and drops it onto another, the spreadsheet is moved to the target folder. However, if a user drops the same spreadsheet onto a printer object instead of a folder, the operating environment makes a copy of the spreadsheet and puts the copy into the printer's queue to be printed. The original spreadsheet is returned to its original location.<a href="1.4.6.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGDRAGPRT"> Figure 38</a> illustrates printing a document by direct manipulation.<br /><br /><a id="FIGDRAGPRT" name="FIGDRAGPRT"> </a><a href="picture-38?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 38" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P38.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 38. Printing by Direct Manipulation. A user can drag a document object to a printer object to print the document.</span><br /><br />The CUA guidelines specify default results for drag and drop actions. The defaults are based on the types of objects (container, data, or device) being manipulated and on the following principles:<br /><br />&deg; When possible, the result of dragging and dropping an object should be the result that a user would expect, given the source object and target object being manipulated.<br />&deg; The result of direct manipulation should be comparatively "safe"--that is, a user should not lose information unexpectedly.<br />&deg; A user should be able to override a default result to obtain a different result.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80">A second technique for interacting with objects involves the use of <i>pop-up</i> <i>menus,</i> which contain only those choices that pertain to an object at the time the menu is displayed. The menus are called pop-up menus because they appear to "pop up" next to an object when a user presses the appropriate key or mouse button. A pop-up menu is available for each object in an interface. Pop-up menus fall between drag and drop and menu bars in the object-action continuum. Access to an object's actions by way of a pop-up menu is more direct than access by way of other types of menus (see<a href="1.4.6.3.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRAMENUS"> "Menus:" in topic 1.4.6.3.2</a>) because a user does not have to select a choice from a menu bar first. However, pop-up menus are less direct than drag and drop.<br /><br />The content of a pop-up menu is based on an object's context, which includes the object's container, the object's contents, and the object's state. Variations in an object's context lead to variations in an object's pop-up menu.<br /><br />When a user displays a pop-up menu for a group of objects, the menu contains only those choices that can be applied to all objects in the group.<br /><br />Pop-up menus are particularly useful for objects that incorporate other objects of different types, each requiring a different set of menu choices. For example, in a page layout product that contains text objects, scanned-image objects, and chart objects, a user could see a different pop-up menu for each type of object.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ13" name="FIGFIGUNIQ13"> </a><a href="picture-39?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 39" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P39.GIF" /></a><br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 39.

  <pre width="80">A <i>choice</i> is text or a graphic that a user can select to modify or manipulate an object. Graphical user interfaces, including the CUA  interface, are full of choices.<br /><br />In the CUA environment there are three types of choices:<br /><br />&deg; Action choices<br />&deg; Routing choices<br />&deg; Settings choices.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Action</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Choices</i>: An <i>action</i> <i>choice</i> immediately performs some task. For example, a choice labeled <b>Print</b> prints an object as soon as the user selects the choice.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ14" name="FIGFIGUNIQ14"> </a><a href="picture-40?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 40" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P40.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 40. Action Choice. The </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Print</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> choice is an action choice. When a user selects the choice, an object is immediately printed on a user's printer.</span><br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Routing</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Choices</i>: A <i>routing</i> <i>choice</i> displays a menu or a window from which a user can select additional choices or specify additional information about the task the user is performing. Except when a routing choice appears on a menu bar (see <a href="1.4.6.3.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRAMENUBA">"Menu Bars" in topic 1.4.6.3.2</a>), the name of a routing choice is followed by a rightward-pointing arrow or an ellipsis (...). The arrow indicates that the choice displays a menu, and the ellipsis indicates that the choice displays a window. For example, a choice labeled <b>Refresh</b> <b>&yuml;</b> displays a menu containing choices such as <b>On</b> and <b>Off</b>, which modify the <b>Refresh</b> <b>&yuml;</b> choice. A choice labeled <b>Sort...</b>displays a window from which a user can specify the order in which items<br />should be sorted. <a href="1.4.6.3.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGRTCHOIC">Figure 41 </a>shows examples of routing choices.<br /><br /><a id="FIGRTCHOIC" name="FIGRTCHOIC"> </a><a href="picture-41?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 41" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P41.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 41. Routing Choices. When a user selects a routing choice, a window or another menu appears. The </span><b style="font-style: italic;">View</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> choice on the menu bar is a routing choice. When a user selects it, a pull-down menu appears. The </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Sort...</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> choice in the </span><b style="font-style: italic;">View</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> menu is also a routing choice.

A settings choice can also be an action choice if the change in a setting occurs as soon as a user selects the settings choice. For example, a choice labeled <b>Blue</b> would allow a user to display or change the color of an object to blue. If the object's color changes as soon as a user selects the choice, the <b>Blue</b> choice is both a settings choice and an action choice.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ15" name="FIGFIGUNIQ15"> </a><a href="picture-42?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 42" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P42.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 42.

  <pre width="80">The CUA interface provides standard mechanisms for indirect manipulation. These mechanisms are called <i>controls,</i> and they are used to display or  obtain certain kinds of information. Various controls can be combined in a view to provide a user a way to modify an object.<br /><a id="HDRAMENUS" name="HDRAMENUS"><br /><br /><i>Menus:</i> A <i>menu</i> is a mechanism for presenting lists of choices to a user.</a> Menus are a staple of most commercially available graphical user interfaces today. The CUA interface includes four types of menus:<br /><br />&deg; Menu bars<br />&deg; Pull-down menus<br />&deg; Cascaded menus<br />&deg; Pop-up menus.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ16" name="FIGFIGUNIQ16"> </a><a href="picture-43?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 43" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P43.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 43. Menus. The CUA interface includes menu bars, pull-down menus, cascaded menus, and pop-up menus.</span><br /><br />Each type of menu is used for a certain purpose or in a certain kind of situation. Menu bars, pull-down menus, and cascaded menus are described in the following sections. However, because pop-up menus are used for direct manipulation rather than indirect manipulation, they are described at<a href="1.4.6.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRCONMENU"> "Pop-up Menus" in topic 1.4.6.2</a>.<br /><a id="HDRAMENUBA" name="HDRAMENUBA"><br /><br /><b style="font-style: italic;">Menu</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Bars</b>: A <i>menu</i> <i>bar</i> appears across the top of most windows, just below</a> the window title. It is a horizontal list of routing choices. When a user selects a choice from a menu bar, an associated pull-down menu is displayed.<br /><br />The name of each routing choice on a menu bar indicates what kinds of choices appear in the associated pull-down menu. By naming the routing choices descriptively, a designer encourages a user to learn by exploring.<br /><br /><b style="font-style: italic;">Pull-Down</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Menus</b>: A <i>pull-down</i> <i>menu</i> is displayed when a user selects a choice from a menu bar. Pull-down menus contain choices that are related to one another in some manner. For example, all choices in a pull-down menu could apply to:<br /><br />&deg; An entire object (the object displayed in a window)<br />&deg; A selected object (within a window)<br />&deg; Help information<br />&deg; A view of an object.<br /><br /><b style="font-style: italic;">Cascaded</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Menus</b>: A <i>cascaded</i> <i>menu</i> is displayed beside a pull-down menu or a pop-up menu when a user selects a routing choice labeled with the &yuml; symbol. A cascaded menu contains choices that modify or are related to the routing choice. Cascaded menus provide a way for a designer to layer choices so that a user can have access to a wide range of function without being confused by lengthy lists of choices.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Entry</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fields</i>: An <i>entry</i> <i>field</i> is an area into which a user can type or place text. Its boundaries are usually indicated. An entry field is appropriate for situations in which the entire possible set of values cannot be predicted. For example, if a product required a user's identification number, a designer typically would specify an entry field as the mechanism for eliciting that information, because the designer has no way to predict the numbers of all possible users.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ17" name="FIGFIGUNIQ17"> </a><a href="picture-44?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 44" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P44.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 44. Entry Field. An entry field is an area into which a user can type information.</span><br /><br />A variation of an entry field is a <i>read-only</i> <i>field.</i> A read-only field contains information that cannot be directly altered by a user. For example, a user cannot alter a read-only field by typing new information over the existing information in the field. However, if the value in a read-only field is calculated automatically according to the values in entry fields, a user could change the value in the read-only field by changing the values in the associated entry fields. For example, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Age</span> field might be a read-only field containing a value calculated from an entry field that contains a birthdate. Although a user cannot change the value in the <b>Age</b> field by directly typing into the field, the user can change the value by changing the value in the <b style="font-weight: bold;">Date</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b style="font-weight: bold;">of</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b style="font-weight: bold;">Birth</b> entry field.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">List</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Box</i>: A <i>list</i> <i>box</i> usually consists of a read-only field and a scroll bar. It is used to display a fixed or variable list of objects or a fixed or variable list of settings choices. Because the display area can be scrolled, the list can contain more items than can be displayed at one time in the display area. The items in the list can be text or graphics, and a user typically can select an item from a list box.<br /><br /><a id="FIGLISTFIG" name="FIGLISTFIG"> </a><a href="picture-45?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 45" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P45.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 45.

A user can type information into the entry field or can fill the entry field by selecting one of the items from the list. A combination box is appropriate when a designer can predict possible values for the entry field and wants to serve the needs of both novice and experienced users. The list box portion of the control prompts novice users to select an appropriate value, while the entry field portion provides a quicker means of interaction for experienced users and allows users to type values not contained in the list.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ18" name="FIGFIGUNIQ18"> </a><a href="picture-46?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 46" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P46.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 46.

For example, a spin button would be appropriate for displaying the days of the week or the months of the year. A spin button is also appropriate for displaying choices that increase or decrease in constant units.<br /><br />The values in a spin button are displayed as if they were arranged in a ring. When a user presses the up arrow ("), the value displayed increases. When a user presses the down arrow (), the value displayed decreases.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ21" name="FIGFIGUNIQ21"> </a><a href="picture-49?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 49" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P49.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 49.

For example, push buttons for a video recorder object might resemble the buttons on a real video recorder.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ22" name="FIGFIGUNIQ22"> </a><a href="picture-51?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 51" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P51.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 51. Modified Push Button Visuals.

Thus, a field of radio buttons always contains at least two radio buttons. Radio buttons prevent a user from selecting incompatible choices. For example, a product might contain the choices <b>On</b> and <b>Off</b> in a single context. Because it would not make sense for an object to be both on and off at the same time, a designer should specify radio buttons to display the mutually exclusive <b>On</b> and <b>Off</b> choices. Likewise, if a field of radio buttons pertained to a car's transmission, it would not make sense for a user to be able to select both an automatic transmission and a manual transmission for the same car. The radio buttons help prevent a user from making an error.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ23" name="FIGFIGUNIQ23"> </a><a href="picture-52?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 52" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P52.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 52.

However, a value set is used primarily for graphical choices, and the choices are arranged in a matrix. Value sets are useful for creating palettes of tools.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ24" name="FIGFIGUNIQ24"> </a><a href="picture-53?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 53" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P53.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 53.

Check boxes are appropriate for choices that have two clearly discernible states. For example, a check box would be appropriate for a choice that locked an object, because a user would easily understand that selecting the check box locks the object, and not selecting the check box leaves the object unlocked.<br /><br />A field of check boxes can contain one or more choices, and a user can select one or more check boxes, or not select any.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ25" name="FIGFIGUNIQ25"> </a><a href="picture-54?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 54" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P54.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 54. Check Boxes. Check boxes provide a way to display choices that are not mutually exclusive. For example, a car could have both air conditioning and power brakes. Each check box choice has two states, such as on or off. Users can easily understand that checking the air conditioning choice means that air conditioning is desired (on), while not checking automatic power antenna means that the antenna is not desired (off).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Slider</span>: A <i>slider</i> is an analog representation of a value. When a slider is used to display a particular value amid a range of possible values, the slider typically shows a scale marked with equal units of value. For example, a designer might use a slider to indicate the volume level of an audio signal. The slider could indicate decibels.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ26" name="FIGFIGUNIQ26"> </a><a href="picture-55?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 55" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P55.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 55. Slider. A slider can be used to display or manipulate specific values.</span><br /><br />When a slider is used to display relative values with no corresponding quantitative value, the slider doesn't necessarily show a scale, but it does indicate what the relative extremes of the scale are. For example, a designer might use a slider to indicate an approximate temperature amid a range of acceptable temperatures. One end of the range could be labeled <b>Low</b> and the other end labeled <b>High.</b>
<br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ27" name="FIGFIGUNIQ27"> </a><a href="picture-56?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 56" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P56.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 56. Slider. A slider can also be used to display or manipulate relative values.</span><br /><br />Some sliders cannot be manipulated. For example, a read-only slider can be used as a progress indicator, but a user cannot alter the value represented by the slider.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ28" name="FIGFIGUNIQ28"> </a><a href="picture-57?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 57" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P57.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 57. Read-Only Slider. A read-only slider can be used to display a value that a user cannot change directly. For example, a read-only slider can be used as a progress indicator.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Notebook</span>: A <i>notebook</i> is used to display any kind of data that can be arranged in distinct groups that a user would find useful. Settings choices are typically displayed in a notebook because a notebook provides a convenient way for a user to change many settings at once. For example, a designer might place all of the settings for a document object into a notebook. Likewise, all of the settings for a printer object could be displayed in a notebook.<br /><br />Objects and other kinds of choices can also be displayed in a notebook. For example, a product could provide a notebook to display a collection of graphic objects, such as clip art.<br /><br /><a id="FIGNOTEBKF" name="FIGNOTEBKF"> </a><a href="picture-58?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 58" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P58.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 58.

Selection</a></h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Through the process of <i>selection,</i> users indicate which items they want to work with. Users can select items by using a pointing device (typically a mouse) or keyboard. To select an item, a user moves the pointer or cursor to the item to be selected and then presses the appropriate mouse button or keyboard key. Most selection techniques that make use of a keyboard parallel those that make use of a mouse, although there are some exceptions.<br /><br />During <i>explicit</i> <i>selection</i> users specifically indicate each item they want to work with. For example, users can move the pointer or selection cursor to each item. When a user explicitly selects an item, the item is highlighted with some kind of visible cue. When a user removes selection from an item, the visible cue is removed as well. The process of removing selection is called <i>deselection.</i> Because an item remains selected until a user deselects it, a user can apply more than one action to a selected item without having to select the item again before each action. A user can explicitly select more than one object at a time.<br /><br />During <i>implicit</i> <i>selection</i> a user can gain access to an item's actions without explicitly selecting the item. For example, a user can display an object's pop-up menu by placing the pointer on the object and pressing the appropriate mouse button. The object is not selected, but its actions are available. Likewise, a user can move the cursor to an item and can get help information (see <a href="1.4.9?DT=19921204095534#HDRAHELP">"Help" in topic 1.4.9</a>) about the item without explicitly selecting the item.<br /><br />An implicitly selected item is not highlighted with a visible cue, and a user can implicitly select only one item at a time.<br /><br />When a user selects an object, the object is not altered in any way, except that the object can become visibly highlighted to indicate that it is selected. A user can select and deselect an object any number of times without otherwise affecting the object. However, when a user selects an action, the action immediately affects whatever object or objects the user has selected. For example, if a user selects an action that updates an object's information, the information is changed immediately.<br /><br /></pre>

Scope of

  <pre width="80">A <i>scope</i> <i>of</i> <i>selection</i> is an area within which a user can select items. For example, one scope of selection might consist of an individual control, such as a list box, while another might consist of a field of controls. Each window is also a separate scope of selection.<br /><br />If a user selects something in a particular scope of selection, a previously selected item in that same scope can be affected, while items selected in other scopes of selection remain unaffected. For example, if a user selects an item in a secondary window, a previously selected item in that window can become deselected, while an item selected in a related primary window remains selected.<br /><br /></pre>

Types of

  <pre width="80">CUA guidelines specify three types of selection:<br /><br />&deg; Single selection, which allows a user to select only one item at a time in a given scope of selection<br />&deg; Multiple selection, which allows a user to select one or more items at a time in a given scope of selection<br />&deg; Extended selection, which allows a user to select one item and then easily extend the selection to other items in the same scope of selection.<br /><br />Each scope of selection uses one of the three types of selection. A designer decides which type to use by considering which result--only one item selected, more than one item selected, or usually one item but sometimes more than one item selected--a typical user will want during selection. The type of selection used is not affected by whether the scope of selection is zero-based or one-based.<br /><br /><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Single</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Selection</i>: <i>Single</i> <i>selection</i> is the process of selecting only one item at a time.

Extended selection is appropriate for scopes of selection in which a user typically wants to select only one item but occasionally wants to select more than one item.<br /><br />To use extended selection in a scope in which single selection is the default, a user first selects one item. Then, to select additional items, the user explicitly indicates that the selection of the first item is to be extended to include the additional items. For example, a user might select an item then press a designated key on the keyboard, alone or in combination with a mouse button. When the user selects another item, the first item remains selected because the user has explicitly indicated (by pressing the designated key or button) that the initial selection is to be extended.<br /><br />Extended selection accommodates the needs of inexperienced users, who tend to select only one item at a time, and it also accommodates the needs of experienced users, who tend to recognize that in some situations selecting more than one item is a more efficient way to work.

  <h4>1.4.6.4.5 Design
Considerations for Selection</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">When deciding how selection should work in a product, a designer must make a series of decisions. The decisions are shown in <a href="1.4.6.4.5?DT=19921204095534#FIGDECTREE">Figure 66</a>.<br /><br /><a id="FIGDECTREE" name="FIGDECTREE"> </a><a href="picture-65?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 65" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P65.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 66. Decisions for Selection. A designer must first consider a user's objects and tasks to determine how many objects the user should be allowed to select at one time within a scope of selection. Next a designer must consider the minimum number of items that must be selected. Then, by evaluating the type of</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">data being presented, the form in which it is presented, and the types of tasks the user will be trying to accomplish, the designer can determine which selection techniques to provide.</span><br /><br />For each scope of selection, a designer must consider a user's objects and tasks to determine how many objects a user will want to select in that scope of selection. The designer also must consider whether a user <i>must</i> select at least one object in that scope. If so, the scope of selection is one-based. If not, the scope of selection is zero-based. If a user will want to select only one object at a time, then the designer provides single selection for that scope. If the user will want to select more than one object at a time, then the designer provides multiple selection for that scope. If the user will typically want to select only one object but might occasionally want to select more than one object, then the designer provides extended selection for that scope.<br /><br />For single selection, a designer must provide point selection and should consider whether to provide automatic selection in addition to point selection. For multiple selection, a designer must provide point selection and either point-to-endpoint selection or random-point selection (or both).<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ30" name="FIGFIGUNIQ30"> </a><a href="picture-66?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 66" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P66.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 67. Random-point Selection. During random-point selection a user selects several items in any order. The items do not have to be contiguous.</span><br /><br />For extended selection, a designer must provide point selection and can provide point-to-endpoint selection or random-point selection or both.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Areas</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">and</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ranges</i>: When a user selects an item or items by using point-to-endpoint selection, the result is either a selected area or a selected range. An area is determined by the spatial arrangement of the selected items, while a range is determined by the meaning or sequence of the objects. For example, in a text document, an area of selection could be delimited by a rectangle defined by a user. A range of selection could be an irregular shape with a beginning point and an endpoint defined by a user, but with the intermediate points determined by the product. <a href="1.4.6.4.5?DT=19921204095534#FIGAREARNG">Figure 68</a> shows the difference between an area of selection and a range of selection in text.<br /><br /><a id="FIGAREARNG" name="FIGAREARNG"> </a><a href="picture-67?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 67" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P67.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 68. Area Selection and Range Selection in Text. In an area of selection, the boundary of the selected text is regular and is based on the spatial area indicated by a user. All items within the area (in this case, a rectangle defined by a beginning point and an endpoint) are selected. In a range of selection, the boundary of the selected text can be irregular. A user defines the beginning point and the endpoint, and the product determines which intermediate points are selected. For some kinds of tasks, a designer might want to provide both area</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">selection and range selection.</span><br /><br />To determine whether the result of point-to-endpoint selection should be an area or a range, a designer must consider the characteristics of the data displayed in the view of the object. A designer must also consider a user's tasks. If the data has linear or tabular characteristics (for example, text, audio waveforms, musical scores, forms, spreadsheets), a user will typically want a range of selection, but for some tasks a user might want an area of selection. For some kinds of data and tasks, a designer might want to provide both area selection and range selection.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ31" name="FIGFIGUNIQ31"> </a><a href="picture-68?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 68" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P68.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 69. Range Selection in Tabular Data. For tabular data, a designer typically provides range selection. For example, in a spreadsheet, a user can define a beginning point anywhere in a cell, then can define an endpoint anywhere in another cell.

  <h3>1.4.6.5 Copying and Creating
Objects</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A user can copy or create objects from existing objects. When a user copies an object, the resulting new object is an exact duplicate of the original object. The new object can even have the same name as the original object, or the user can change the object's name. When a user creates an object, the resulting new object is similar but not identical to the original object, and it has a new name. The original object is, in effect, a template for the new object. A designer can provide designated objects that act as templates for creating new objects. The designated objects have special visual representations.<a href="1.4.6.5?DT=19921204095534#FIGTEMPFG"> Figure 70</a> shows a template of a folder.<br /><br /><a id="FIGTEMPFG" name="FIGTEMPFG"> </a><a href="picture-69?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 69" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P69.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 70. A Folder Template. A user can create a new folder by using direct or indirect manipulation on an existing object.</span><br /><br />For example, if a user copies a text document, say an invoice, the new invoice will contain all of the text, settings, and other elements of the original invoice and will have the same invoice number. However, if a user creates a new invoice from an existing invoice, the new invoice will contain some--but not all--of the information in the original invoice. The newly created invoice might contain the same company name, mailing address, and entry fields as in the original invoice, but the invoice date and invoice number would be different, and the customer name and other entry fields would not contain the same information as the original.<br /><br />A designer decides how much information is transferred from one object to another during object creation and bases the decision on the objects and tasks involved. In the invoice example above, a relatively small amount of information is transferred to the newly created invoice. For some objects and tasks, however, nearly all of the information might be transferred. For example, an attorney might work with a set of document objects containing boilerplate text. When the attorney creates a new object, all of the text, except for a client's name, date, and other particulars, is transferred to the new object.<br /><br />A user can copy and create objects by both direct and indirect manipulation.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h4>1.4.6.5.1 The Clipboard</h4>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">When using indirect manipulation to copy or create objects, a user uses the <i>clipboard.</i> The clipboard is an area of storage provided by the operating system to hold data temporarily. A user can copy, create, and move objects to and from the clipboard. The objects are held on the clipboard until the user replaces them with other objects or until the user turns off the system.<br /><br />The clipboard can hold entire objects or parts of objects, and it can hold any kind of object. For example, the clipboard can hold a single line of text or an entire document object, a single data record or an entire database, a single line segment or an entire graphic. Except when necessary to prevent the corruption of data, a designer should not restrict a user from placing any objects or parts of objects onto the clipboard.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.4.7.2 Progress Indicators</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">To provide feedback to a user during longer (typically five seconds or more) processes, a designer can use a <i>progress</i> <i>indicator.</i> A progress indicator is a visible cue that indicates progress toward the completion of a process, for example copying or sorting a group of objects. A progress indicator can indicate a specific amount of time. For example, a progress indicator could consist of a digital clock that displays the time remaining in a process. A progress indicator can also indicate a relative amount of time. For example, a progress indicator could consist of a slider that fills gradually as the process continues. When the process is complete, the slider is completely filled. A progress indicator can appear in its own window or in the window of the object that is undergoing the process.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ33" name="FIGFIGUNIQ33"> </a><a href="picture-71?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 71" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P71.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 72.

  <h3>1.4.7.4 Status Areas</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A <i>status</i> <i>area</i> differs from an information area in that it displays information about the view of an object rather than about the object itself. For example, a status area could display a count of the number of objects in a container displayed in a view, or it could indicate whether the information displayed in the view has been sorted or filtered. A status area typically appears at the top of a window, below the menu bar.<br /><br /><a id="FIGSTATAR" name="FIGSTATAR"> </a><a href="picture-73?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 73" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P73.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 74.

  <h2>1.4.8 Exception Handling</h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">An <i>exception</i> is any event or situation that prevents or has the potential to prevent a user's action from being completed in the manner the user expects. Exceptions occur when a product is unable to interpret a user's action.<br /><br />Thoughtful application design can often prevent exceptions. For example, if a designer specifies a way to indicate to a user that a choice is unavailable, the user is less likely to try to select that choice. However, because a designer cannot predict every possible action a user might attempt, a product should include provisions for notifying users about exceptions and should provide ways to help users recover from them.<br /><br />Users typically do not expect an exception to occur, although experienced users can learn to recognize situations that lead to an exception. For example, a user might habitually attempt to close an object without first saving any changes made to the object. Each time the user attempts to close an object, a typical product would notify the user that the object has been changed and that the changes are about to be discarded. Eventually the user would come to expect the exception.<br /><br />When an exception occurs, a product needs to tell a user at least three things:<br /><br />&deg; How severe the situation is<br />&deg; How soon the user must respond<br />&deg; What actions the user can take to correct the situation.<br /><br />Because most users do not expect most exceptions, a designer should take care to choose a notification method that will inform a user without alarming the user. There are many methods for conveying this information to a user. A designer should choose methods appropriate for the users' tasks and work environment, and a designer should apply the methods consistently throughout a product. In addition, the designer should make sure that the notification methods complement the help (see<a href="1.4.9?DT=19921204095534#HDRAHELP"> "Help" in</a><a href="1.4.9?DT=19921204095534#HDRAHELP"> </a><a href="1.4.9?DT=19921204095534#HDRAHELP">topic 1.4.9</a>) provided by the product so that a user can completely understand the exception and how to respond to it.<br /><br />Typical methods for notifying a user about an exception include:<br /><br />&deg; Audible cues<br />&deg; Visible cues<br />&deg; Textual cues.<br /><br />Each is discussed in the following sections.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h4>1.4.8.1 Audible Cues</h4>





  

  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">An <i>audible</i> <i>cue</i> is a sound generated by a user's computer to draw a user's attention. A beep is an example of a simple audible cue. If a product will be used with computer hardware that has advanced audio capabilities, a designer can be imaginative in specifying more elaborate audible cues, such as speech synthesis, for example.<br /></pre>

  <h4>1.4.8.2 Visible Cues</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A <i>visible</i> <i>cue</i> is a change in the appearance of a product's components. For example, if a user places an inappropriate type of information in an entry field, the color of the entry field could change to alert the user that the information falls outside the range of acceptable values for that entry field.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ36" name="FIGFIGUNIQ36"> </a><a href="picture-75?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 75" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P75.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 76. Visible Cue. A visible cue can be used to indicate to a user that different information is required.</span><br /><br />If an object other than the object a user is working with requires some attention from the user before an exception can be resolved, the appearance of the object's icon could change. For example, if a printer has run out of paper, the icon that represents the printer could change.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ37" name="FIGFIGUNIQ37"> </a><a href="picture-76?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 76" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P76.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 77.

  <h4>1.4.8.3 Textual Cues</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">When a user needs more information than can be conveyed with an audible cue or visual cue, a designer can use a textual cue. A textual cue consists of a word or words describing the exception. A textual cue can be displayed in a message window.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h4>1.4.8.4 Examples of Exceptions
and Their Corresponding
Notifications</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">The following examples illustrate notification methods for alerting a user to a problem.<br /><br />1. A user types an inappropriate value into an entry field.<br /><br />A product could do one or more of the following:<br /><br />&deg; Generate an audible cue.<br />&deg; Change the color of the background of the entry field containing the error.<br />&deg; Display a message window that describes the error, explains how to correct the error, and provides controls that allow the user to correct the error from within the message window (for example, the message window could contain an entry field into which the user could type an appropriate value).<br /><br />After the user supplies an appropriate value, the background color of the entry field would change back to its usual color, and the message window would close.<br /><br /><br />2. A printer runs out of paper, and the user has not opened a window for the printer object.<br /><br />A product could do one or more of the following:<br /><br />&deg; Change the appearance of the printer's icon to indicate that the printer needs attention.<br />&deg; Generate an audible cue.<br />&deg; Display a message window as soon as the user opens a window for the printer object. The message window would describe the situation and would contain a push button that allows the user to close the message window.<br /><br />After the user supplies the printer with paper, the printer's icon would change back to its normal appearance.<br /><br /></pre>

Help</a></h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />A product should provide information to a user about how to use the product and how to recover from exceptions. Information about how to use a product is known as help information. Ideally, a product's help facilities should work together with its methods and mechanisms for exception handling to provide a user with all of the information needed to solve any problem the user might encounter.<br /><br />Help information describes a product's choices, objects, and interaction techniques. Help information can help a user learn to use a product and can serve as a refresher when a user has not used a product regularly or recently.<br /><br />Products designed for a CUA environment should provide several kinds of help:<br /><br />&deg; Information about the contents of a window and the tasks a user can perform in the window<br />&deg; Information about any selected item, including the item's purpose and ways to interact with the item<br />&deg; Information about the key assignments on the keyboard<br />&deg; An index of all of the topics for which help is available<br />&deg; Information about using the help facility.<br /><br /></pre>

5. The CUA
Designer's Model--A Summary</a></h1>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />When combined, the classes of objects described in Chapter 1 (see <a href="1.1.4.1?DT=19921204095534#HDROBJTYPE">"Object</a><a href="1.1.4.1?DT=19921204095534#HDROBJTYPE"> </a><a href="1.1.4.1?DT=19921204095534#HDROBJTYPE">Classes" in topic 1.1.4.1</a>), the design principles described in Chapter 3, and the components of the CUA interface described in Chapter 4 form a designer's model of the CUA user interface. The following sections present a summary of how these parts are related in the CUA user interface.<br /><br />The CUA designer's model contains all of the fundamental concepts, components, and relationships in a CUA environment. A designer can use the CUA designer's model as a foundation for developing products that are user-oriented. Elements of the CUA designer's model can be reused and extended to create a user interface appropriate for the intended users' tasks.<a href="1.5?DT=19921204095534#FIGCUADESM"> Figure 78</a> illustrates the CUA designer's model, including the  interrelatedness of the components of the CUA user interface.<br /><br /><a id="FIGCUADESM" name="FIGCUADESM"> </a><a href="picture-77?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 77" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P77.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 78. Designer's Model of the CUA Interface. Each arrow represents a relationship between two of the boxed items on the chart. Characteristics of the relationship are indicated by the direction of the arrow and by the text beside each arrow. For example, the arrow that points from Container to Object means</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">that a container is an object. Double bars indicate a one-to-many relationship. For example, one container object can contain many other objects.</span><br /><br />The three sections of the figure--object relationships, visual representations, and interaction mechanisms--correspond to the three layers of the iceberg model of interface design (see<a href="1.2.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGICEBERG"> Figure 8 in</a><a href="1.2.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGICEBERG"> </a><a href="1.2.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGICEBERG">topic 1.2.3</a>).<br /><br />The figures in the following sections highlight and elaborate on some of the relationships in the CUA user interface.<br /><br /></pre>

  <pre width="80"><br />To illustrate one approach to the process of designing a product with a CUA user interface, we designed a sample product, and we documented our steps. This chapter describes those steps. Designers can follow these steps or can adapt this process to suit their needs.<br /><br />We designed a product that could be used for selling new cars at a car dealership. Our design is a partial design only, intended to highlight the main design considerations and the processes a designer can follow when developing a user interface. A full-fledged product design would contain much more detail.<br /><br />The product is an example only, and it is not intended to represent the practices of a particular car dealership, nor is it intended to represent the ideal product for all car dealerships. Likewise, our process is an example only. This process worked for us, but a different process might work equally well for a different group of designers.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h2>1.6.1 Overview of the
Development Process</h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre></pre>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">The basic steps in our development process were:<br /><br />&deg; Researching and planning<br />&deg; Designing<br />&deg; Prototyping<br />&deg; Testing.<br /><br />Each of these steps entails one or more subprocesses of its own, and we went through each step for each part our product's interface. When we tested each part of our product, we compared the results with the objectives we set during the planning stage. If the results met our customer's requirements and our requirements, we proceeded to design the next part of the interface. If not, we changed the design and tested the product again. This process is known as an iterative development process. <a href="1.6.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGITERDES">Figure 84</a> illustrates the iterative development process.<br /><br /><a id="FIGITERDES" name="FIGITERDES"> </a><a href="picture-82?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 82" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P82.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 84. Iterative Development Process. For each part of our product's interface, we developed a prototype and tested the prototype.

That is, we looked for ways to:<br /><br />&deg; Provide immediate feedback for each action<br />&deg; Reduce the number of steps required to accomplish a task<br />&deg; Provide full function with a small number of objects<br />&deg; Increase a user's control over the product<br />&deg; Reduce the potential for exceptions<br />&deg; Reduce the effect of exceptions<br />&deg; Allow a user to use either the keyboard or the mouse to accomplish a task<br />&deg; Provide interaction techniques suited to the needs of novice users and expert users.<br /><br />Finally we arrived at a satisfactory design.<br /><br />The rest of this chapter describes the processes we used in researching, planning, and designing our product. Although prototyping and testing also have their own processes, a detailed discussion of prototyping and testing is beyond the scope of this book. However, we will say that we tested our product for consistent behavior and for compatibility with a user's expectations. We also sought feedback from test subjects about whether the product was pleasing to use.<br /><br /></pre>

  <pre width="80"><br />First we recognized that we were serving two distinct audiences: the people who buy a product (our customers) and the people who use a product (our users). Sometimes the two audiences overlap, but in this case, our customers were the upper management staff of a car dealership, while the users were primarily the sales staff and lower management staff.<br /><br />To begin our iterative development process we had to:<br /><br />&deg; Gather requirements from upper management<br />&deg; Learn about the users and their tasks<br />&deg; Match management's requirements to the users' tasks.<br /><br /></pre>

Instead, they gave us high-level information about what they hoped to gain by using our product.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>1.6.2.2 Step 2. Learning about
Users and Their Tasks</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">To serve the needs of the users of our product, we had to gather information about the users. We interviewed a salesperson with extensive experience at car dealerships. He helped us compile a profile of car salespeople, the primary users of our product.<br /><br />In particular, we were interested in salespeople's:<br /><br />&deg; Experience<br />- How much experience do they have doing their job?<br />- How much experience do they have using computers?<br />- How much experience do they have using similar user interfaces?<br />&deg; Capabilities<br />- With what styles do they approach their work?<br />- How do they learn new systems?<br />&deg; Motivations<br />- How will the new product affect their work routine?<br />- How will the new product affect their productivity?<br />&deg; Desires<br />- How would they like to use the product?<br />- What kinds of features would they like to see in the product?<br /><br />We found out that salespeople:<br /><br />&deg; Are not experienced in using computers<br />&deg; Are not interested in programming computers<br />&deg; Vary in their ability and interest in learning new procedures<br />&deg; Use varied techniques to sell cars<br />&deg; Are competitive<br />&deg; Are knowledgeable about the products they sell<br />&deg; Want to be able to communicate with their customers while they use the product.<br /><br />After analyzing the characteristics of our product's intended users, we realized that our product's interface must:<br /><br />&deg; Be easy to learn<br />&deg; Be flexible enough to serve users with different approaches to both learning and sales<br />&deg; Contain elements resembling those already used in a salesperson's job<br />&deg; Contain terms that are familiar to a salesperson<br />&deg; Be sophisticated enough to withstand scrutiny of people who are knowledgeable about their field<br />&deg; Be appropriate to be seen by a customer.<br /><br />We also needed to learn about the tasks the users perform in their jobs. With the help of our expert salesperson, we drew an organization chart for a typical car dealership. The organization is shown in <a href="1.6.2.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGAUTODEA">Figure 85</a>.<br /><br /><a id="FIGAUTODEA" name="FIGAUTODEA"> </a><a href="picture-83?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 83" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P83.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 85.

The salesperson in turn asks the customer what features and price range the customer is looking for. Using the information the customer provides, the salesperson gathers information about the dealership's cars that match the customer's requirements. The salesperson then presents the information to the customer.<br /><br />If a car appeals to the customer, the customer takes the car for a test drive. If the customer still is interested in the car after the test drive, the salesperson and customer negotiate about the financial arrangements. They use a worksheet to record the details of the proposed purchase. Once they come to an agreement, the salesperson takes the worksheet with the agreed-to figures to the sales manager for approval. If the sales manager approves the sale, the salesperson passes the<br />worksheet along to the finance manager.<a href="1.6.2.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGUSERS"> Figure 87</a> lists the tasks of the salesperson, the sales manager, and the finance manager.<br /><br /><a id="FIGUSERS" name="FIGUSERS"></a><a id="TBLUSERS" name="TBLUSERS"> ________________________________________________________________________________ </a><br />| <span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 87.

  <h3>1.6.2.3 Step 3. Matching
Management's Requirements to the
Users' Tasks</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">After gathering requirements from management and analyzing the users' tasks, we had to match the requirements and the tasks. We realized that our product's interface had to provide:<br /><br />&deg; A way to record information about a customer (thus meeting the requirement to eliminate paperwork)<br />&deg; Quick access to information about the dealership's stock of cars (thus meeting the requirements to reduce errors and to reduce time spent tracking down information)<br />&deg; A way to combine customer information with dealership information (thus meeting the requirement to eliminate paperwork)<br />&deg; A way to quickly transfer information among users--salespeople, sales manager, finance manager--without leaving the customer unattended (thus meeting the requirements to reduce paperwork and increase contact time).<br /></pre>

  <h2>1.6.3 Designing the Product</h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />After we completed our research and planning, we began designing the product. First we designed our intended users' model; that is, we took the information we had learned about salespeople and used it to create a model that describes the way the salespeople would understand how the product works. Then we defined the objects, their relationships, and their behaviors, and we decided what kinds of views were needed to allow the salespeople to work with the objects. Then we designed the menus and choices for the objects, and finally, we designed the windows that contained the views and controls through which the salespeople could work with the objects.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>1.6.3.1 Step 1. Defining the
Objects</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Our analysis of a salesperson's tasks gave us the base of information we needed to start defining objects for our product. At this stage of design, we were interested in what objects a user needs, how the objects are related, and how the objects behave.<br /></pre>

  <h4>1.6.3.1.2 Determining the
Relationships and Behaviors of the
Objects</h4>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Once we had determined which objects we needed, we had to determine how each object interacted with the other objects.<br /><br />We drew a diagram to show the relationships among the objects.<br /><br /><a id="FIGMAINACT" name="FIGMAINACT"> </a><a href="picture-85?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 85" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P85.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 89. Relationships among the Car Dealership Objects</span><br /><br />Then we considered the flow of information among the objects. To complete a worksheet, a salesperson combines information from a car object and a customer object. While we did not want to prevent a salesperson from typing or re-typing all of the information contained in those objects, we knew that typing is slow and can lead to errors. We knew we could provide a quicker and more accurate way to transfer the information by allowing a salesperson to manipulate the information directly--that is, by dragging the customer and car objects to the worksheet objects--or indirectly, by using action choices that allow the salesperson to copy information from one object and place it into another.<br /><br />Once a worksheet is complete, a salesperson must get approval from the sales manager and then must send the worksheet to the finance manager to close the sale. One solution might have been to allow the salesperson to print a copy of the worksheet and carry it in person to the managers. However, one of the requirements we received from the dealership's upper management was to eliminate paperwork, so we decided that electronic mail offered the most efficient paperless solution. Also, by sending the worksheet electronically, the salesperson can stay in contact with the customer instead of leaving the customer alone while the salesperson locates the appropriate manager.<br /><br />We had to decide what the results of direct manipulation would be for various combinations of source objects and target objects. In particular, we were interested in whether data should transfer from one object to another when a salesperson drags a source object to a target object. Based on the relationships we defined, we created the following table to illustrate the default results of direct manipulation of pairs of objects.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGADIRMAN" name="FIGADIRMAN"></a><a id="TBLADIRMAN" name="TBLADIRMAN"> ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ </a><br />| Figure 90.

  <h4>1.6.3.1.1 Determining What
Kinds of Objects Are Needed</h4>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">To decide what objects a salesperson needed, we looked at the real-world objects a salesperson used to sell a car. We wrote a description of a salesperson's tasks and underlined all the nouns:<br /><br />&deg; Find out the <u>customer's</u> <u>wants,</u> <u>needs,</u> and <u>budget.</u>
&deg; Find out what the <u>car</u> <u>dealership</u> has in <u>stock</u> that most closely  matches the <u>customer's</u> <u>wants,</u> <u>needs,</u> and <u>budget.</u>
&deg; Arrive at an <u>agreement</u> using a <u>worksheet</u>.<br />&deg; Get <u>approval</u> from the <u>sales</u> <u>manager.</u>
&deg; Give the <u>worksheet</u> <u>information</u> to the <u>finance</u> <u>manager.</u>
<br />After underlining the nouns, we made a list of them:<br /><br />&deg; Salesperson<br />&deg; Customer<br />&deg; Wants<br />&deg; Needs<br />&deg; Budget<br />&deg; Agreement<br />&deg; Worksheet<br />&deg; Car<br />&deg; Dealership<br />&deg; Stock<br />&deg; Sales manager<br />&deg; Finance manager.<br /><br />To create our final list of objects, we edited the list of nouns to eliminate duplication and to combine those concepts that seemed to fit together. We ended up with this list of objects:<br /><br />&deg; Car<br />&deg; Car lot (the entire collection of individual cars available for sale)<br />&deg; Customer (including the customer's wants, needs, and budget)<br />&deg; Customer list (the entire collection of individual customers)<br />&deg; Worksheet (the commonly used term for the agreement)<br />&deg; Worksheet list (the entire collection of individual worksheets)<br />&deg; Salesperson<br />&deg; Sales manager<br />&deg; Finance manager.<br /><br />These objects are described in the following sections.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Car</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: Each car object represents a real car for sale in the car lot. A car object contains descriptive information about the corresponding real car, such as its year, make, model, price, factory-installed options, color, and vehicle identification number (VIN). Because the primary purpose of a car object is to convey information, the car object is a data object.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Car</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Lot</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: The car lot object represents the physical lot where the dealership's cars are parked. Because the primary purpose of a car lot object is to hold car objects, the car lot object is a container object. A typical dealership sells new cars and used cars. The two kinds of cars are often parked in different lots. To make our product seem more familiar to users, we provided two car lot objects: a new car lot and a used car lot. Our sample product uses only the new car lot, but a fully developed product for a dealership would use both car lot objects.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Customer</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: Each customer object represents a real customer who has inquired about a car. A customer object contains descriptive information about the corresponding real customer, such as the customer's name, address, telephone number, and identification number. Because the primary purpose of a customer object is to convey information, the customer object is a data object.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Customer</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">List</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: The customer list object contains all of the customer objects, much as the car lot object contains all of the car objects. It is a container object.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Worksheet</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: A worksheet object contains information about the customer and the car to be purchased, along with other information, such as the financial arrangements of the purchase. A worksheet object is a data object.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Worksheet</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">List</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: A worksheet list object contains all of the worksheet objects, just as the customer list object contains all of the customer objects. It is a container object.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Salesperson</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: Each salesperson object represents one of the dealership's salespeople. A salesperson object contains descriptive information about the corresponding real salesperson, such as the salesperson's name, address, sales record, commissions, and bonuses. It is a data object. Because our sample transactions take place from the salesperson's perspective, we did not need to use the salesperson object. However, in a fully designed product for a real car dealership, a salesperson object might be used for payroll or personnel tasks.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Sales</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Manager</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">and</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Finance</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Manager</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Object</i>: At first we considered creating the sales manager and the finance manager objects so that they were like the customer and salesperson objects--that is, they would contain descriptive information about each person. However, to sell a car, a salesperson does not require descriptive information about either manager. From a salesperson's perspective, a sales manager and a finance manager receive and distribute information. Because the users of our sample product are salespeople, we decided to emphasize the passing of information by representing the finance manager and the sales manager as specially tailored out-baskets for electronic mail. They are device objects that automatically send their contents to the corresponding individual.<br /><br /><a href="1.6.3.1.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGHANDMO">Figure 88</a> shows our preliminary drawing of these objects.<br /><br /><a id="FIGHANDMO" name="FIGHANDMO"> </a><a href="picture-84?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 84" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P84.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 88. Hand Drawing of Users' Objects. The drawing indicates how the objects might appear on a salesperson's screen. We later realized that the sales manager object and the finance manager object could be represented differently, in a way that more accurately conveyed the nature of a salesperson's transactions with the real managers.</span><br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>1.6.3.2 Step 2. Determining
the Necessary Views</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Once we had identified and defined the objects, we had to determine which kinds of views would give the salespeople the best access to the objectsand the information they contain. In determining the views needed, weconsidered the ways in which a salesperson would interact with each objectand its information. We also provided a help view for each object.<br /></pre>

Object</h4>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Both a salesperson and a customer need to know general information about a car, and a salesperson needs a way to work with the information. We decided that the best way to present the information would be a combination of textual information and graphical information. The text would describe the make, model, and year of the car. The graphic would be a picture of the car. We drew a sketch of a proposed General Information view of a car.<br /><br /><a id="FIGHANDST" name="FIGHANDST"> </a><a href="picture-86?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 86" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P86.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 91.

  <h4>1.6.3.2.2 Views of the Car Lot

  <pre width="80">Because the car lot is a container, we knew we had to provide at least the two standard contents views: an icons view and a details view. For the icons view, we decided to group vehicles according to type, and we decided to represent each type of vehicle with a different icon.<a href="1.6.3.2.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGHANDNCS"> Figure 92</a> shows  our initial sketch of an icons view of the car lot.<br /><br /><a id="FIGHANDNCS" name="FIGHANDNCS"> </a><a href="picture-87?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 87" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P87.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 92. Hand-Drawn Version of an Icons View of the Car Lot</span><br /><br />In a dealership that does not use computers in the process of selling cars, a salesperson typically searches manually through a file or listing of the cars available on the car lot. When a customer is ready for a test drive, a salesperson has to walk through the real car lot to locate the car. We decided that a more efficient approach would be to offer a salesperson several ways to look for particular cars available for sale, and we wanted to let the computer, rather than the salesperson, do the actual searching for available cars.<br /><br />Because a customer is typically interested in only certain cars in the car lot, we decided to provide a way for a salesperson to specify criteria for which cars to include in either contents view of the car lot. We added a feature to the contents views to allow a salesperson to filter the view so that it displays only the cars that have the features the customer wants. (See <a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRINCLCAR">"The Window for the Filtering Feature" in topic 1.6.3.4.2</a> for more  details.) By using this feature, a salesperson can filter the view of the cars according to:<br /><br />&deg; Year<br />&deg; Make and model<br />&deg; Color<br />&deg; Price range<br />&deg; Installed features.<br /><br />We decided that once a salesperson has filtered the view so that only certain kinds of cars are displayed, the salesperson might also want to sort the displayed cars according to the same kinds of criteria. (See <a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRSORTCAR">"The Window for the Sorting Feature" in topic 1.6.3.4.2</a> for more details.)<br /><br />Finally, we decided to provide a <b>Map</b> view that showed the positions of the real cars on the real car lot. The <b>Map</b> view is a composed view of the car lot. It saves the salesperson and customer time by pinpointing the location of the car that the customer wants to test drive.<br /><br />The settings view for the car lot object provides a way for a user to change the appearance of some aspects of the car lot object. For example, a user can change the size of the icons that represent the car objects.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80">The general information associated with each customer includes the customer's<br /><br />&deg; Name<br />&deg; Address (street, city, state, ZIP code)<br />&deg; Phone numbers<br />&deg; Identification number<br />&deg; Driver's license number<br />&deg; Date of birth.<br /><br />Additional information associated with a customer might include detailed financial information, such as the customer's<br /><br />&deg; Assets<br />- House<br />- Car<br />- Stocks<br />- Savings<br />- Income<br />&deg; Debts<br />- Rent or mortgage payments<br />- Consumer loans<br />- Credit card balance and credit limit.<br /><br />This kind of information can be thought of as a customer's attributes or "settings," so we decided to provide a settings view. Settings views can be displayed well in a notebook.<a href="1.6.3.2.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGHANDPI"> Figure 93</a> shows our initial sketch of  the notebook for the customer object.<br /><br /><a id="FIGHANDPI" name="FIGHANDPI"> </a><a href="picture-88?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 88" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P88.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 93.

Customer List Object</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">The customer list is a container object; therefore it needed at least an icons view and a details view. We also decided to provide a mechanism called the <b>Include</b> <b>Customers</b> window that allows a salesperson to filter and sort the customer objects. Because the views of the customer list are similar to the contents and settings views of the car lot, we do not describe them further here.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80">The worksheet list, like the customer list and the car lot, is a container object. We provided the usual contents views: an icons view and a details view. We also decided to provide a mechanism called the <b>Include</b> <b>Worksheets</b> window that allows a salesperson, finance manager, or sales  manager to filter and sort the worksheet objects. Because the views of the worksheet list are similar to the contents and settings views of the car lot and the customer list, we do not describe them further here.<br /></pre>

  <h3>1.6.3.3 Step 3. Designing the

  <pre width="80">We consulted <a href="2.0?DT=19921204095534#HDRPART2">Part 2, "CUA Reference"</a> for information about the standard CUA menus. To determine the product-specific choices we needed for our product, we considered how the object behaviors we had defined corresponded to the views we had decided upon. We also considered the relationships between various users and the objects. For example, a salesperson is not responsible for placing real cars into or removing real cars from the real car lot. To make our sample product seem more like the real world that the users are familiar with, we restricted the salesperson's access to the car lot object by providing a limited set of choices in the menus for the car lot object. A salesperson is allowed to view information about a car object in the car lot object but cannot add or remove car objects. In a fully designed product, some other person, perhaps a lot attendant or a sales manager, would have access to the car lot object to add or remove cars. However, because a salesperson is in the best position to know whether a customer is seriously interested in a car, the salesperson is allowed to create a new worksheet object and add it to or remove it from the worksheet list object.<br /><br />The following sections discuss the menus for the objects.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h4>1.6.3.3.2 Menus for the Car

  <pre width="80">From a salesperson's perspective, most of the information about a car object is fixed--that is, the information is based on a real-world object and cannot be changed unless something changes about the real-world object. For example, it would not make sense to allow a salesperson to change the color of a car object, because its color corresponds to the color of the real car that the car object represents. Because a salesperson can change little about a car object, the car object has only a few menus, and the menus contain relatively few choices.<a href="1.6.3.3.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGCAROBJM"> Figure 96</a> shows the menus for the <b>General</b> <b>Information</b> view of the car object.

  <h3>1.6.3.4 Step 4. Designing the
Windows</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">We consulted <a href="2.0?DT=19921204095534#HDRPART2">Part 2, "CUA Reference" </a>to design the actual contents of the windows for our sample product.<br /><br />The descriptions below do not contain all of the components possible in windows of products with a CUA interface; our product did not need all of them. Nor are the window designs definitive. A different group of designers might have designed windows with different components.<br /><br />We considered three principle aspects of each window:<br /><br />&deg; The window frame (includes the window border, window title, the scroll bars, the system menu symbol, and the window sizing buttons)<br />&deg; The menus (includes the menu bar, the pull-down menus, and any cascaded menus needed for choices in the pull-down menus)<br />&deg; The contents of the window (the view).<br /><br />Because our product is an example only, we did not design all of the windows for all of the objects. The designs described in the following sections are representative only; they are not comprehensive.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80">We designed only one window for the car object, a window to display the general information view.

  <h4>1.6.3.4.2 Windows for the Car
Lot Object</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">We designed several windows for the car lot object, including windows for displaying the contents views (icons view and details view), windows from routing choices, and a window for the composed view (the map view).<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Window</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">for</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">the</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Icons</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">View</i>: A salesperson displays this window by opening the car lot object. The window contains icons representing car objects. The car icon is a generic representation of a car. We considered creating a separate icon for each car model, one that closely resembled the model it represented, but we knew that many of the distinguishing features would not be easy to see even on icons of a normal size and would be indiscernible in views, such as the details view, that display small icons.<br /><br />Because salespeople are competitive, we knew that we should provide a way to indicate when a car has a potential buyer. We designed a small graphic of a human figure to augment the car icon when a salesperson has an interested customer. When a car icon is augmented with the buyer figure, a salesperson can decide to speed the close of a sale so that his or her customer can make the purchase before another customer does, or the salesperson can decide to steer a customer to a different car that is not being considered by another customer. The car icon is augmented automatically by the system when a salesperson transfers car information to a worksheet or when a customer takes a car for a test drive.<br /><a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGIVIEW">Figure 109</a> shows the window for the icons view of the car lot object. The icons of the Hutton Sapphire, the Hutton GT, and the Watson Faser are augmented.<br /><br /><a id="FIGIVIEW" name="FIGIVIEW"> </a><a href="picture-97?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 97" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P97.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 109. Window Displaying the Icons View of the Car Lot Object. Each icon represents one car in the car lot. Three of the six icons are augmented.</span><br /><br /><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Window</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">for</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Details</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">View</i>: This window can be displayed by opening the car lot object to a details view or by selecting the <b>Details</b> choice from the <b>View</b> menu.<br /><br />In the details view we wanted to display the most frequently used information about each car, so we arranged the year, make, model, price, number of buyers, and vehicle identification number (VIN) in columns. Then we placed a column heading over each column of data to identify the items in that column. We designed the window so that the column headings are in a different part of the window than the list of cars. This design allows a salesperson to scroll the list of cars vertically without losing sight of the headings. However, when the salesperson scrolls the list horizontally, the headings scroll with the columns. Otherwise the headings would be displayed over the wrong columns.<br /><br />We designed the window to scroll in both directions. The horizontal scrolling is helpful when the salesperson makes the window small enough that not all of the columns are displayed. The vertical scrolling is helpful when the salesperson makes the window small enough that not all of the lines are displayed.<br /><br />We included a status area at the top of the window to tell the salesperson when the window had last been refreshed and whether the view had been filtered.<a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGDVIEW"> Figure 110</a> shows the window for the details view of the car lot object.

The <b>Include...</b> choice is a routing choice that appears in the pull-down menu from the <b>View</b> choice on the menu bar of the icons and details views of the car lot object. The Include Cars window appears when a salesperson selects the <b>Include...</b> choice. It is a secondary window.<br /><br />Our first design of the <b>Include</b> <b>Cars</b> window for appears in <a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGICARS">Figure 111</a>. Although we subsequently changed the design of the window, we have included our original design here to illustrate how we used the iterative design process to improve our product.<br /><br /><a id="FIGICARS" name="FIGICARS"> </a><a href="picture-99?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 99" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P99.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 111. First Design of the Include Cars Window</span><br /><br />To allow a salesperson to specify the filter criteria, we provided several types of controls. For the <b>Model,</b> <b>Make,</b> and <b>Color</b> fields, we used drop-down combination boxes. The drop-down characteristic saves space in the window, the entry field portion of the control allows a salesperson to type the appropriate information, and the list box portion of the control allows a salesperson to select the desired information without having to type it.<br /><br />We used two spin buttons for the <b>Price</b> field, and we provided a ring of values in $1,000 increments. The spin buttons allow the salesperson to specify a minimum and maximum price for the cars to be displayed in the contents views (icons and details).<br /><br />To allow a salesperson to specify the features of the cars to be displayed in the contents views, we used a pair of list boxes with three associated push buttons. The list box on the left contains the features that are available for a particular make, model, and year of car. The list box on the right is where the salesperson creates a list of the features that the customer does and does not want. To create the list in the list box on the right, the salesperson selects a feature from the list box on the left, then selects the <b>With</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> push button if the customer wants that  feature. The salesperson selects the <b>Without</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> push button if the  customer does not want that feature.<br /><br />Features added to the list box on the right appear with a check mark if they were added with the <b>With</b> push button.<br /><br />When a salesperson wants to remove a feature from the list, the salesperson selects the feature in the list box on the right, then selects the <b>Delete</b> push button.<br /><br />At the bottom of the window we placed some standard CUA-defined push buttons: <b>Include,</b> <b>Close,</b> and <b>Help.</b> When a salesperson selects the <b>Include</b> push button, the window containing the contents view of the car lot displays all of the cars that match the criteria specified in the Include Cars window, and the Include Cars window remains open.<br /><br />The <b>Close</b> push button closes the Include Cars window without changing the display in the Icons or Details window of the car lot.<br /><br />A salesperson can select the <b>Help</b> push button to display contextual help for the control or choice that the cursor is on.<br /><br />To assist salespeople in learning to use our product, we provided an information area at the bottom of the Include Cars window. When a salesperson moves the cursor to a control, the information area displays information about how to use that control. For example, when the cursor is on the <b>Available</b> list box, the information area displays a message that says something like this:<br /><br /><samp>Select</samp> <samp>a</samp> <samp>feature</samp> <samp>from</samp> <samp>this</samp> <samp>list.</samp><br /><samp>Then</samp> <samp>use</samp> <b>With</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> <samp>or</samp> <b>Without</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> <samp>to</samp> <samp>add</samp> <samp>the</samp> <samp>feature</samp> <samp>to</samp> <samp>the</samp> <b>Desired</b> <samp>list.</samp>
<br />During a usability test, we discovered that the <b>Available</b> and <b>Desired</b> list boxes and the <b>With</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> and <b>Without</b> <b>&gt;&gt;</b> push buttons didn't make sense to our users. Consequently we redesigned the Include Cars window to make it easier to understand and to reduce the number of decisions that salespeople had to make. In particular, we added two fields that contain the features customers ask for most often.<a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGICARS2"> Figure 112</a> shows the redesigned Include Cars window.<br /><br /><a id="FIGICARS2" name="FIGICARS2"> </a><a href="picture-100?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 100" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P100.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 112. New Version of the Include Cars Window</span><br /><br />To alleviate the confusion that resulted when salespeople had to transfer a feature from one control to another, we used check boxes and radio buttons instead of the list boxes. The check boxes are appropriate for most of the options because the salespeople can easily understand the implications of checking an option or not--that is, a salesperson realizes that checking the <b>Air</b> <b>conditioning</b> choice means that the customer wants air conditioning, and not checking it means that the customer does not want air conditioning. For the <b>Transmission</b> choices, however, check boxes were not appropriate because a car must have some kind of transmission. Therefore, we used radio buttons so that a salesperson has to select which kind of transmission the car should have. To accommodate customers who will accept either kind of transmission, we provided a <b>No</b> <b>preference</b> choice.<br /><a id="HDRSORTCAR" name="HDRSORTCAR"><br /><br /><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Window</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">for</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Sorting</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Feature</i>: We named the sorting feature <b>Sort...,</b></a> aptly enough. The <b>Sort...</b> choice is a routing choice that appears in the pull-down menu from the <b>View</b> choice on the menu bar of the car lot object. The Sort Cars window appears when a salesperson selects the <b>Sort...</b> choice. It is a secondary window.<br /><br />A salesperson can select the <b>Sort...</b> choice to specify the order in which the cars should appear in the details view of the car lot object. We used drop-down lists to display the names of the sorting categories so that a salesperson would not have to remember the names of the appropriate sorting values. The values correspond to the column headings shown in the details view.<br /><br />We designed two alternatives for the Sort Cars window. In the first version, we used radio buttons and text as the mechanism for specifying the sort order. <a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGOSD">Figure 113</a> shows this version.<br /><br /><a id="FIGOSD" name="FIGOSD"> </a><a href="picture-101?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 101" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P101.GIF" /></a><br /><br style="font-style: italic;" /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 113. Version 1 of the Sort Cars Window. In this version of the window design, we used radio buttons as the mechanism for specifying the sort order.</span><br /><br />In the second version, we used value sets containing graphics that depict the sort order.<a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGSDIALOG"> Figure 114</a> shows this version.<br /><br />The push buttons in both versions operate much like the push buttons in the Include Cars window.<br /><br /><a id="FIGSDIALOG" name="FIGSDIALOG"> </a><a href="picture-102?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 102" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P102.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 114. Version 2 of the Sort Cars Window. In this version of the window design, we used value sets as the mechanism for specifying the sort order.</span><br /><br />It is not uncommon for designers to produce more than one proposed solution to a design problem. Usability testing is the only way to determine which design is superior.<br /><br />When the salesperson selects the <b>Sort</b> push button the details view of the car lot object is sorted as shown in <a href="1.6.3.4.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGSORTV">Figure 115</a>.

The view contains drawings of the showroom and the parking places in the car lot. Car icons in the parking places indicate where the corresponding cars are parked.<br /><br />Car lot attendants are the primary users of this view of the car lot. As the lot attendants move cars into and out of the lot, they update the information displayed in this view. However, salespeople use the map view to find out the location of cars that customers want to test drive. Furthermore, a salesperson can drag a car icon to the showroom. By doing so, the salesperson signals a lot attendant to bring the car to the showroom so that a customer can take it for a test drive. When a sale is closed, the salesperson drags the car icon to the service building so that the service manager can schedule the pre-delivery prep work for the car.<br /><br />Other dealership workers can also use the map view. Sales managers can analyze sales patterns by using the map view. If the map view were tied to the sales database, the sales managers might be able to learn, for example, that cars parked in the first two rows of the lot sell more quickly than cars parked at the back of the lot. The map view can also be used to take a physical inventory of the cars in stock.<br /><br /><a id="FIGMAPVW" name="FIGMAPVW"> </a><a href="picture-104?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 104" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P104.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 116.

  <h4>1.6.3.4.3 Windows for the
Customer Object</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A salesperson needs to be able to enter, view, and work with the customer information, so we decided to display these groups of information in two sections of a notebook control, one for general information and one for financial information. The notebook control was the obvious choice because the information can be grouped easily and because the design of the notebook control can be helpful in controlling access to certain information. For example, if we wanted to restrict access to a customer's financial information, we could include security measures that allow only the salesperson and the finance manager to have access to that section of the notebook.<a href="1.6.3.4.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGPIWIN1"> Figure 117</a> shows the first page of the general information  section of the customer object.<br /><br /><a id="FIGPIWIN1" name="FIGPIWIN1"> </a><a href="picture-105?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 105" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P105.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 117. Window for the Customer Object. A notebook control with divider tabs displays information about a customer. The divider tabs, labeled </span><b style="font-style: italic;">General</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> and </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Financial,</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> indicate the major groups of information.</span><br /><br />The general information section of the notebook has four pages. On the first page we provided entry fields for most of the information because entering the information is the only way to acquire the information. For the <b>Name,</b> <b>City,</b> <b>Zip,</b> <b>Home,</b> and <b>Work</b> fields, we used single-line entry fields. For the <b>Street</b> field we used a multiple-line entry field. We made the entry fields large enough to display a typical customer's information, so we did not provide scroll bars.<br /><br />We provided a drop-down combination box for the <b>State</b> field. The drop-down combination box allows a salesperson either to type in the two-letter abbreviation for the state or to scroll through and select from a list of all of the abbreviations.<br /><br />Because most of a car dealership's customers live in the vicinity of the dealership, we pre-filled some of the entry fields with the values most likely to appear in them. For example, because our dealership is in North Carolina, we pre-filled the <b>State</b> field with NC, and we pre-filled the <b>Home</b> and <b>Work</b> fields with the area code for the area where the dealership is located. Of course the salesperson can changes these values.<br /><br />Each field has a field prompt, and some fields are grouped with a group heading. For example, the <b>Street,</b> <b>City,</b> <b>State,</b> and <b>Zip</b> fields are grouped under the <b>Address</b> group heading, and the <b>Home</b> and <b>Work</b> fields are grouped under the <b>Telephone</b> group heading.<br /><br />A salesperson can move the cursor from one entry field to the next by pressing the Tab key or by moving the pointer and clicking the mouse button.<br /><br />The second page of the general information section of the notebook looks like this:<br /><br /><a id="FIGPIWIN2" name="FIGPIWIN2"> </a><a href="picture-106?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 106" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P106.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 118. Customer Window, Page 2</span><br /><br />Our product automatically calculates the value for the <b>Age</b> field, which is a read-only field, by reading the values the salesperson enters into the <b>Date</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> field. Descriptive text appears to the right of the <b>Date</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> field to let the salesperson know the correct format for the date of birth information.<br /><br />Some of the customer information has inherent characteristics that we could use to help verify whether the salesperson has entered appropriate values. For example, state information must be two alphabetic characters, and the identification number must be nine numeric characters. When a salesperson enters a value for one of these pieces of information, our product checks the entered information to ensure that it has the correct characteristics. If it does not, the product alerts the salesperson.<br /><br />We considered two methods for alerting a salesperson. First we considered changing the background color or contrast of the entry field as soon as the salesperson enters an inappropriate value. Then we considered displaying a message window that describes the problem and provides controls that allow the salesperson to correct the problem from within the message window. For example, if a salesperson enters fewer than nine digits for the identification number or enters alphabetic characters instead of numbers, our product would display a message like this:<br /><br /><a id="FIGAMESS" name="FIGAMESS"> </a><a href="picture-107?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 107" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P107.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 119. Message Window</span><br /><br />We decided the first method might be too subtle for our intended users, so we settled on the message window.<br /><br />The third and fourth pages of the general information section contain settings choices that pertain to the customer object itself rather than to the customer that the object represents. The pages are similar to the page shown in <a href="1.4.5.1.3?DT=19921204095534#FIGSETFIG">Figure 34 in topic 1.4.5.1.3</a>. We placed these pages behind the other pages in the section because a salesperson will use the customer object information less often than the customer information found on the first two pages.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h4>1.6.3.4.4 Windows for the
Worksheet Object</h4>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">The worksheet object is the most important because it is where all of the elements of the sale come together: the customer, the car, and the money. However, if we had tried to display all of the information about the car, customer, and money at once, a salesperson would have had difficulty reading and working with the information. We used a notebook control to organize the information into sections that are meaningful to a salesperson and that reflect the tasks the salesperson wants to accomplish. A salesperson can get to any section of the notebook by selecting the tab for that section.<br /><br /><a href="1.6.3.4.4?DT=19921204095534#FIGWORKMBS">Figure 120</a> shows the worksheet window. The page displayed is the actual  worksheet that the salesperson uses when negotiating the sale. Several of the entry fields are filled in automatically when the salesperson transfers the customer and car information to the worksheet. For example, the <b>Vehicle,</b> <b>VIN,</b> and <b>Retail</b> fields are filled according to information from the car object. The values for some of the other fields are based on defaults suggested by the dealership. For example, the <b>License</b> <b>fee</b> field automatically displays the standard licensing fee for the state in which the dealership is located. If a customer plans to license the vehicle in a different state, the salesperson can type a different value into the field or can change the amount to $0. The <b>Net</b> <b>price</b> and <b>Balance</b> fields are read-only fields. The values they contain are calculated according to the values contained in other fields.<br /><br /><a id="FIGWORKMBS" name="FIGWORKMBS"> </a><a href="picture-108?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 108" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P108.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 120.

  <h3>1.6.4.1 Scenario of Use</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Sean O'Toole walks into an automobile dealership looking for a particular kind of car. Mary Walsh, the dealership's top salesperson greets Sean and asks him what kind of car he is interested in.<br /><br />"Do you have any Hutton ProSport cars?" Sean asks.<br /><br />"Just a minute. Let me check," Mary responds.<br /><br />Mary leads Sean to her desk, where she has a workstation. She moves her pointing device, a mouse, until the pointer is on an icon that represents the dealership's new car lot. She double-clicks on the icon and a window appears on her display screen. The window contains many icons that resemble cars. The color of each icon is the same as the color of the car it represents.<br /><br />"This window shows me all the new cars we have in stock," she explains.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ38" name="FIGFIGUNIQ38"> </a><a href="picture-109?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 109" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P109.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 121.

By double-clicking on an icon labeled New Car Lot, Mary opens this window.</span><br /><br />She moves the pointer to the <b>View</b> choice on the menu bar and clicks on the choice. A pull-down menu appears. Then she moves the pointer to the <b>Details</b> choice in the <b>View</b> menu and clicks on the choice.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ39" name="FIGFIGUNIQ39"> </a><a href="picture-110?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 110" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P110.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 122.

Mary opens this window by clicking on the </span><b style="font-style: italic;">Include...</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> choice in the </span><b style="font-style: italic;">View</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> menu. By using the controls in this window, Mary can indicate which cars she wants to see in the New Car Lot window.</span><br /><br />Its title is <b>New</b> <b>Car</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>-</b> <b>Include</b> <b>Cars,</b> and it contains controls that allow Mary to specify which kinds of cars are to be included in the view of the new car lot.<br /><br />"Let's see. You wanted a Hutton ProSport, right? This year's model?" Mary<br />asks.<br /><br />"Yes."<br /><br />"What color and what kinds of options do you want?"<br /><br />"Red, and I want air conditioning and cruise control. I don't care whether the transmission is automatic or manual."<br /><br />"How much do you want to spend?"<br /><br />"Well, I don't want a plain car, but I don't need the top-of-the-line option package either."<br /><br />After filling in the entry fields of the drop-down combination boxes and checking the appropriate options, Mary adjusts the price field based on her knowledge of the range of prices for the ProSport model. Then she clicks on the <b>Include</b> push button. The <b>New</b> <b>Car</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>-</b> <b>Include</b> <b>Cars</b> window closes, and the contents of the <b>New</b> <b>Car</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>-</b> <b>Details</b> window change.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ42" name="FIGFIGUNIQ42"> </a><a href="picture-113?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 113" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P113.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 125.

A window displaying general information about the car appears. Mary reads the information and says, "No, it has a six-cylinder engine. Let's try another one." She double-clicks on the system-menu symbol and the window closes.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ43" name="FIGFIGUNIQ43"> </a><a href="picture-114?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 114" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P114.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 126.

When the window appears, she sees that the car does have a four-cylinder engine.<br /><br />"Would you like to see the car? Maybe take it for a test drive?" Mary asks.<br /><br />"Yes," Sean replies, "but where is it? I didn't see any ProSports on the lot when I came in."<br /><br />"No problem," Mary says. "I'll find it on the map."<br /><br />Mary moves the pointer to the title bar of the new car lot window and clicks on it to make the window active. Then she moves the pointer to the icon of the car Sean is interested in. She clicks on it to select it. Then she selects the <b>Map</b> choice from the <b>View</b> menu.

She drags the icon to the showroom. "The lot attendant will bring the car around front.

Mary asks.<br /><br />"No, I haven't."<br /><br />"Then I need to get some information from you."<br /><br />They return to Mary's workstation, where Mary double-clicks on an icon labeled <b>Customer</b> <b>List.</b> A window appears. It contains icons representing the dealership's customers. Mary moves the pointer to an existing customer icon and clicks to select the icon. Then she moves the pointer to the <b>Edit</b> menu and clicks. A pull-down menu appears. Mary moves the pointer to the <b>Create</b> choice and clicks on it. A newly created customer object is stored on the clipboard.<br /><br /><a id="FIGCUSTFG2" name="FIGCUSTFG2"> </a><a href="picture-116?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 116" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P116.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 128.

The newly created customer object on the clipboard is placed in the customer list. Mary moves the pointer to the icon of the new customer object and double-clicks. A window opens containing a notebook. The <b>Name</b> field is highlighted and it contains the words "New customer."<br /><br />"How do you spell your last name?" Mary asks.<br /><br />"O-T-O-O-L-E." Mary types as Sean speaks, and Sean's name replaces the words "New customer." Mary presses the Tab key to move the cursor to the <b>Street</b> field.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ45" name="FIGFIGUNIQ45"> </a><a href="picture-117?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 117" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P117.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 129. Window for the Customer Object</span><br /><br />Sean tells her his address and telephone number and Mary fills in the rest of the entry fields.<br /><br />"I think you forgot to change the state. I live in Virginia, not North Carolina," Sean says.<br /><br />"Okay, I'll change it."<br /><br />While pressing and holding the Alt key, Mary presses the T key, which is the mnemonic for the <b>State</b> field. The cursor moves to the <b>State</b> field. She types in the abbreviation for Virginia. Once the customer information is entered correctly, Mary moves the pointer to an icon labeled <b>Worksheet</b> <b>List.</b> She double-clicks on the icon and a window opens. The worksheet list contains all of the worksheets in progress for various customers, and the window opens to an icons view.<br /><br />To create a new worksheet object, Mary could follow the same procedure she used to create a new customer object--that is, by indirect manipulation. However, she chooses to create a new worksheet by direct manipulation. She double-clicks on a folder icon labeled <b>New</b> <b>Things.</b> The folder opens.

Then you can decide which is better for you."<br /><br />Mary selects Sean's worksheet, then copies it and pastes the copy into the worksheet list.<br /><br />Mary and Sean then discuss the prices and conditions of the sale. As they agree on prices, Mary enters them into the appropriate fields on the worksheets. Sean decides he will trade in his old car. The worksheets automatically calculate the net price and balance due. Finally, Mary says, "You're a tough bargainer. I need to ask my sales manager, Peter Liczinski, if he will agree to these figures."<br /><br />Mary drags the icon for the worksheet containing the trade-in information to an icon that represents an electronic mail out-basket.

Would you like some coffee while we wait?"<br /><br />After a few minutes, Mary's terminal makes a sound and her electronic mail in-basket flashes to indicate that a message has arrived. Mary double-clicks on the in-basket and a window opens showing the contents of the in-basket. Mary double-clicks on the icon of the single message in the in-basket, and another window opens.

"I'll send this information to the finance manager, Rachel Green. She'll help you finish the transaction. In the meantime, I'll get your car ready for you."<br /><br />Mary drags the icon for the completed worksheet to another out-basket icon labeled <b>To</b> <b>Green.</b> Then she takes Sean to Rachel's office. After introducing them, she returns to her terminal to tidy up the windows.<br /><br />She wants to get rid of the unused worksheet, so she drags the icon to an icon labeled <b>Delete</b> <b>Folder.</b> The delete folder will delete the worksheet for her.<br /><br /><a id="FIGFIGUNIQ47" name="FIGFIGUNIQ47"> </a><a href="picture-123?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 123" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P123.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 135.

  <pre width="80"><br />Objects are the focus of a user's attention. The CUA guidelines define three types of objects: device, data, and container.<br /><br />The CUA guidelines do not define particular types of data objects. However, guidelines are provided for interacting with data objects, such as text objects.<br /><br />The CUA guidelines define four types of container objects that other objects can be placed into: folders, delete folders, work areas, and workplaces.<br /><br />Each product defines the objects and properties necessary for that product, and the object-specific actions that can be applied only to those objects. The CUA guidelines define how the objects are displayed on the desktop or workplace, such as in windows, and how the actions are presented to a user, such as in menus.<br /><br /><i>Related</i> <i>Topics</i>

  <h3>2.1.3.3 Windows</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Windows are used to present views of objects. In an application-oriented operating environment, users typically open a window and then specify the object they wish to interact with. In an object-oriented operating environment, a view of an object is displayed in the window when the window is opened. This is one difference between an application-oriented operating environment and an object-oriented operating environment: users can display views of objects directly without first specifying the application used to display that view. Another key difference is that in an application-oriented operating environment, the same window could be used to display other objects. In an object-oriented operating environment there is a one-to-one relationship between objects and<br />windows. When a window is open on an object, in order to view another object, the object is displayed in a separate window.<br /><br />Windows are also used to present messages, progress indicators, help information, and choices that further clarify actions.<br /><br />In both application-oriented and object-oriented operating environments, multiple windows can be shown on the screen at the same time. If windows overlap, the active window (the window the user is interacting with) is usually placed on top of any overlapping windows. The two basic types of windows are: primary windows and secondary windows.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h4>2.1.3.3.2 Secondary window</h4>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Secondary windows look very much like primary windows. For example, both have window borders and title bars. The important distinction between primary and secondary windows is based on how they are used. Secondary windows are always associated with a primary window and contain information that is dependent on an object in the primary window. Secondary windows are used, for example, to allow a user to further clarify action requests. Secondary windows are removed when the primary window is closed or minimized, and redisplayed when the primary window is<br />opened or restored. <a href="2.1.3.3.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGSECONID">Figure 143</a> shows a typical secondary window.<br /><br /><a id="FIGSECONID" name="FIGSECONID"><br /></a></pre>

  <h3>2.1.3.1 Views of Objects</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Opening a window on an object displays a view of the object. An object may have more than one view to allow a user to see other aspects of the same object. The CUA guidelines define four common types of views: composed, contents, settings, and help. The appearance of composed and contents views are object-specific. A user can change the view of an object by selecting another view from a menu. The CUA guidelines recommend that the settings view for an object be displayed using a notebook control and help views be displayed by opening another window.<br /><br />A user can display multiple, simultaneous views of an object in multiple windows by opening the same object multiple times. To see different parts of a view in the same window, a <b>Split</b> choice could be provided to allow a user to split the window into different sections. In <a href="2.1.3.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGVIEWID">Figure 138</a> a contents view and a settings view of the same object are displayed.<br /><br /><a id="FIGVIEWID" name="FIGVIEWID"><br /></a></pre>

Icons that represent applications appear in containers used to group such objects. Users can manipulate these icons to accomplish tasks such as moving the object to a new container. Also, users can start applications by opening the icon for that application.<br /><br />In OS/2 1.3, for example, icons on the desktop also represent minimized windows of running applications. When a user double-clicks or restores a minimized window's icon, the icon disappears from the desktop and is replaced by an open window.<br /><br />In an object-oriented operating environment, icons represent objects. When a user opens an icon, the icon remains visible but is visually augmented to indicate that it is currently in use. This augmentation, or emphasis, is called in-use emphasis.<br /><br />When a user opens an object, a window is opened to display a view of the object. </a><a href="2.1.3.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGMOVEID">Figure 141</a> shows an icon being moved from one container to another container.

  <h3>2.1.2.1 Creating New Objects</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">There are several methods available to a user to create new objects. In an application-oriented environment, new objects are created by opening an application window and either selecting the <b>New</b> choice to create a new object or by selecting the <b>Save</b> <b>as</b> choice to copy an existing object.<br /><br />The <b>New</b> choice is used to create a new object in the window where <b>New</b> was  selected. The new object is typically of the same class as the existing object in the window, but unique information can be automatically generated for it when it is created. This unique information may be simple, such as a new form number, or it can be more elaborate information taken from the current context. The newly created object reuses the same window from which the <b>New</b> choice was selected. The location of the new object is not determined when the object is created; instead, it is specified by the user from the <b>Save</b> <b>As</b> window when the <b>Save</b> <b>as</b> choice is selected or when the window is closed.<br /><br />The <b>Save</b> <b>as</b> choice is used in an application-oriented environment to create a new object based on an existing object. When this choice is selected while working with an existing named object in a window, a copy of the object is made and the <b>Save</b> <b>As</b> window is displayed to allow the user to specify a name and location for the new object. The original object in the window is not affected.<br /><br />Two other choices, <b>Create</b> and <b>Copy,</b> are provided in both application-oriented and object-oriented environments from menus, or their function can be provided through direct manipulation. In an object-oriented environment, new objects are created by finding another object of the desired type and requesting that a new one either be created from this object or copied from this object. In an application-oriented environment, <b>Create</b> and <b>Copy</b> are typically used to create or copy objects within the window. In an object-oriented environment, <b>Create</b> and <b>Copy</b> can be used for objects within a window, as well as objects on the workplace.<br /><br />When using menus the <b>Create</b> choice is selected from the <b>Edit</b> menu or from the pop-up menu of an object. The <b>Create</b> choice uses the clipboard. Like the <b>New</b> choice, this choice may generate unique information for the new object. A default name is usually generated for the new object, although the user could change this name later. The location of the new object is determined by the user when the <b>Paste</b> choice is selected.<br /><br />Like the <b>Create</b> choice, the <b>Copy</b> choice is selected from the <b>Edit</b> menu or from the pop-up menu of an object and uses the clipboard. The new object can have the same name as the original object if unique names are not required. The location of the new object is determined by the user when the <b>Paste</b> choice is selected.<br /><br />When using direct manipulation, the default operation when a user drags an object can be either a move or a copy. A user can override a default operation, for example, to request that an object be copied instead of moved by pressing a mouse button. In addition, an object may have a create-on-drag setting that allows the user to specify whether when overriding the move default a create operation should be performed instead of the <b>Copy.</b> When this setting is on, the appearance of the object's icon is changed to reflect that the create operation will occur instead of the copy.<br /><br />In many situations it may be convenient for users to create a folder containing sample objects from which users can create new objects. Each object in this folder would have the create-on-drag setting on to allow the user to easily create new objects by dragging objects out of this folder (using the override key) to the desired location.<br /><br />In addition to creating new objects a user can create a reflection of an object. Objects that support reflections will have cascaded choices off the <b>Create</b> choice to specify that a reflection is desired. In addition, a user could create a reflection during direct manipulation.<br /></pre>

  <h2>2.1.1 Operating Environment</h2>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><br />The CUA guidelines support the development of products that are to be used in application-oriented operating environments and object-oriented operating environments. The operating environment establishes a basic framework of function that products can utilize. The environment typically includes such basic functions as management functions for windows, files, printers, and configuration options.<br /><br />An application-oriented environment is one in which users must first start applications in order to work with objects. The CUA graphical model, first published in 1989, defines a graphical user interface for products that are designed to be used in an application-oriented operating environment. The IBM Operating System/2* (OS/2*) 1.3 operating system is an example of an application-oriented operating environment.<br /><br />In an application-oriented environment, groups of available applications are initially represented in application-manager windows as small graphic images called icons. A user can start an application which then displays its own window (or group of windows) from which a user performs tasks related to the application. While an application is running, a user can reduce the size of its window to a minimum size and position it in a handy place on the screen, which is typically referred to as the desktop. The desktop is the screen in an application-oriented operating environment. <a href="2.1.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGAPPOE">Figure 136</a> is an example of an application-oriented operating environment.<br /><br /><a id="FIGAPPOE" name="FIGAPPOE"><br /></a></pre>

  <pre><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 136. Example of an Application-Oriented Environment</span><br /><br />In OS/2 1.3 a minimized window appears as an icon on the desktop but represents a running application. A user can manipulate running applications on the desktop, but cannot place objects on the desktop. Data transfer within and between applications is typically accomplished by using the <b>Cut,</b> <b>Copy,</b> and <b>Paste</b> menu choices associated with a system-provided clipboard.<br /><br />Also introduced in 1989 was the workplace extension to the graphical model. The desktop in an object-oriented environment is called the workplace. The workplace extension defines an object-oriented user interface to support the development of products that are to be used in an object-oriented operating environment. In this environment, icons represent objects rather than running applications. A user no longer must start an application before selecting the object to work with. Instead, the user opens the object which automatically causes a window to be displayed that contains a view of the object. In addition to choosing actions from menus, a user can drag objects--represented as icons on the workplace--to perform some operations. For example, a text object can be printed by dragging its icon to the icon of a printer object. <a href="2.1.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGRV036">Figure 137</a> is an example of the workplace in an object-oriented operating environment.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGRV036" name="FIGRV036"><br /></a></pre>

  <pre><span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 137. Example of an Object-Oriented Environment</span><br /><br />An object, such as a document, often contains other objects, such as graphs, charts, and tables. The workplace extension defines techniques that allow a user to perform actions on an object as a whole and on objects that are contained within other objects.<br /><br />Because interfaces are evolving to support an object-oriented environment, the CUA guidelines in this book emphasize object-orientation. However, many of the CUA guidelines apply equally to both application-oriented and object-oriented environments. For example, dragging techniques and pop-up menus can be supported within and between product windows on the workplace even if they are not supported on the desktop of an application-oriented environment. By defining interface features useful in both application-oriented and object-oriented environments, the CUA guidelines allow you to position your products advantageously for the evolution to an object-oriented interface while maintaining compatibility with many aspects of an existing application-oriented interface.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80">Messages are feedback to the user that occur because of a condition the operating environment or an object in the operating environment has detected. Messages tell a user that something has happened because of a request or that something undesirable or unexpected could occur. The CUA guidelines define three types of messages: information message, warning message, and action message. These three message types are based on the user actions that can be performed, not on the severity of the message.<br /><br />Messages should clearly indicate why the message appeared and what actions can be taken. You can always provide access to help information in any kind of message to further aid a user in determining the problem or to learn how to correct the situation.<br /><br /><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Information</i><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><i style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Message</i>: An information message appears when a situation occurs that a user can do nothing about.

  <pre width="80">When a user requests a lengthy process, a progress indicator is used to indicate that the process is running and to provide information about the status of the process, such as how far it is from completion.

When displayed in a separate window, the window may also contain information that may otherwise have been displayed in an information message.<br /><br /><a href="2.1.3.3.5?DT=19921204095534#FIGPROIND">Figure 149</a> shows an example of a progress indicator in a window.<br /><br /><a id="FIGPROIND" name="FIGPROIND"><br /></a></pre>

  <pre width="80">Controls are components of the interface that allow a user to select choices and to type information. Menus are one type of control that is commonly used to contain choices. Other controls are used, for example, in settings views of objects and in windows that clarify an action request. However, controls may also be used in any view of an object.<br /><br />Some controls can perform the same function, but are better suited for certain tasks or presentation schemes. For example, list boxes, combination boxes, drop-down list boxes, and drop-down combination boxes all perform similar functions. However, some of these controls allow a user to type values not provided by the control or require less space in a window. Because there are many different ways of allowing a user to interact with the interface, the CUA guidelines provide different controls to allow a user to work most efficiently.<a href="2.1.3.5?DT=19921204095534#FIGCONTRID"> Figure 151</a> shows some examples of controls.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGCONTRID" name="FIGCONTRID"><br /></a></pre>

  <pre width="80">The types of menus defined by the CUA guidelines are:<br /><br />&deg; Menu bars<br />&deg; Pull-down menus<br />&deg; Cascaded menus<br />&deg; Pop-up menus.<br /><br /><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Menu</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Bar</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">and</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Pull-Down</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Menu</i><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span><i style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Contents</i>: Menu bars are displayed at the top of a window, under the window title. Each choice in the menu bar is a routing choice that leads to an associated pull-down menu. Choices in the pull-down menus are typically action or routing choices that relate to the contents of the window, though settings choices are also allowed. When routing choices are used, they lead to other windows or to cascaded menus.<br /><br />The CUA guidelines define the common contents of the <b>File,</b> <b>Selected,</b> <b>Edit,</b> <b>View,</b> <b>Options,</b> <b>Windows,</b> and <b>Help</b> menu bar choices. In addition, the contents of the system menu pull-down are also defined. The system menu is shown as a graphical choice in the top, left-hand corner of the window, in the title bar.<br /><br />The menu bar choices and contents defined in this version of the CUA guidelines provide an evolutionary step towards an object-oriented menu scheme. Below is a brief description of these choices, along with a description of the system menu and its contents.<a href="2.1.3.5.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGAPPMEN"> Figure 152</a> and <a href="2.1.3.5.1?DT=19921204095534#FIGOBJMEN">Figure 153</a> show the layout of the predefined menu choices on the menu bar and title bar and also shows the predefined choices within those pull-down menus. Additional information about these choices is found in "Common User Access Interface Components" beginning on page<a href="2.2?DT=19921204095534#HDRTOPICS"> 2.2</a>.<br /><br /><b>File</b> The <b>File</b> menu contains choices that affect the overall object in the window. There are two types of <b>File</b> menus: application-oriented and object-oriented.<br /><br /><b>Application-Oriented</b><br />Contains choices that affect the underlying object presented in the application-oriented window. For example, the <b>File</b> menu could contain an <b>Open</b> choice that allows a user to change the object presented in the window.<br /><br /><b>Object-Oriented</b><br />Contains choices that affect the underlying object presented in the object-oriented window. The label of this choice is the class name of<br />the underlying object that is shown in the window. For example, in the <b>File</b> pull-down menu for a window displaying a view of a folder, the label of the menu-bar choice would be <b>Folder,</b> and its pull-down menu could contain the <b>Open</b> <b>as</b> choice that would allow a user to open new windows displaying views of the same underlying object.<br /><br /><b>Selected</b> The <b>Selected</b> menu is used for containers and data objects where objects within the window can be selected and actions applied to them. If the objects in the window are not homogeneous, then the available choices in this menu may vary widely, depending on which object is selected. For example, the names of the views listed from the <b>Open</b> <b>as</b> choice, may be very different depending on the views available for the selected object. The <b>Selected</b> menu has the same contents as the <b>File</b> menu for the selected object if a window was opened on that object.<br /><br /><b>Edit</b> The <b>Edit</b> menu contains choices that are standard across many different object types, such as the choices that provide access to the clipboard.<br /><br /><b>View</b> The <b>View</b> menu contains choices that change the view type or some aspects of the view, such as the <b>Include,</b> <b>Sort,</b> and <b>Refresh</b> choices.<br /><br /><b>Options</b> The <b>Options</b> menu contains choices that allow a user to tailor the behavior and appearance of an application-oriented product.<br /><br /><b>Windows</b> The <b>Windows</b> menu contains choices that provide access to other windows that are related to the same task.<br /><br /><b>Help</b> The <b>Help</b> menu contains choices that provide access to help information.<br /><br /><b>System</b> <b>menu</b> The system menu contains choices that change the visual characteristics of a window and other operating-environment-specific functions. Included in this menu is a <b>Close</b> choice for closing the window.<br /><br /><a id="FIGAPPMEN" name="FIGAPPMEN"><br /></a></pre>

  <h3>2.1.4.1 Selection</h3>





  

  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A user interacts with an object by identifying the desired object and indicating actions to apply to that object. CUA interface guidelines define that a user must indicate an object or group of objects first, and then choose actions to apply to the object or group of objects.<br /><br />A user can implicitly or explicitly indicate, or select, an object. An object that is implicitly selected does not require a specific selection action by a user and does not display selected-state emphasis. For example, a user does not need to first explicitly select an object in order to request its pop-up menu. Pointing at an object and requesting its pop-up menu will implicitly select the object. However, to request a pop-up menu for a group of objects, the user must explicitly select all objects to be included in the group.<br /><br />An object that is explicitly selected is put into a selected state. This selected state is indicated with selected-state emphasis. Because an object stays selected until it is deselected, multiple actions can be applied to the same object without selecting that object multiple times.<br /><br />Selecting an object does not imply an action, affect the object itself, or commit a user to some action. A user can select or deselect the object without changing the object in any way. In contrast to selecting an object, selecting an action causes something to happen to the selected object. For example, when the <b>Delete</b> choice is applied to a selected object, that object is deleted.<br /></pre>

  <h4>2.1.4.1.2 Selection Techniques</h4>





  

  

  
  
  
  
  <pre>Selection techniques are the interaction mechanisms used for selecting objects. The CUA guidelines define techniques for both the keyboard and the mouse. Of the techniques specified, some are appropriate for selecting one object at a time, and others are appropriate for selecting multiple objects.<br /><br />All selection techniques defined by the CUA guidelines are either point selection, point-to-endpoint selection, or random-point selection. The specific behavior of the selection technique depends on the selection type used, the type of object being selected, and the view of that object.<br /><br />Point selection allows a user to select one object at a time. For example, the user moves the cursor to the object and presses the spacebar or clicks on the object with the mouse.<br /><br />Point-to-endpoint selection allows a user to select all objects between two or more specified points. For example, a user can define two ends of a rectangle to select all objects fully contained within that rectangle; however, in a different type of view, any object or part of an object that falls within the defined area might be selected.<br /><br />Random-point selection allows a user to select objects as the pointer passes over them, in whatever order the user chooses.<br /><br /><i>Related</i> <i>Topics</i>

  <pre width="80">The CUA guidelines define three types of selection based on the number of objects that can be selected:<br /><br />&deg; The first type, single selection, allows at most one object to be selected at any time in a scope.<br />&deg; Multiple selection allows a user to select one or more objects at any time in a scope.<br />&deg; Extended selection allows a user to select only one object at a time or to extend the selection to more than one object.<br /><br />One of these types of selection must be defined for each group of objects. For each of the controls discussed in <a href="2.1.3.5?DT=19921204095534#HDRCONTHD">"Controls" in topic 2.1.3.5</a>, one or more of these types of selection are already defined.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>2.1.4.2 Data Transfer</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Users can transfer data within an object, or from one object to another by dragging with the pointing device or by using the clipboard choices (<b>Cut,</b> <b>Copy,</b> <b>Create,</b> and <b>Paste</b>). Data-transfer operations allow a user to move data, copy data, or create a new object.<br /><br />When a mouse is used, a user first identifies the object to be transferred. The object is identified by pressing the mouse manipulation button while the pointer is over the object. If more than one object is to be dragged, then the objects must be selected before the transfer. While holding the mouse manipulation button down, the user moves the mouse and drags the object or group of objects until it is at the desired location. The characteristics of the source and target object determine what the default operation for the object will be, such as a move or copy. The user can be allowed to override this default operation by pressing a<br />key before dropping the object at the desired location.<br /><br />The user can also transfer data by using the clipboard. The clipboard provided by the operating environment can be accessed by any object that provides the <b>Cut,</b> <b>Copy,</b> <b>Create,</b> and <b>Paste</b> choices.<br /><br />To retrieve the contents of the clipboard, the user selects the <b>Paste</b> choice. A copy of the contents of the clipboard is pasted at the cursor position. Because the clipboard contents are preserved, the paste action can be repeated to get additional copies or, for the <b>Create</b> choice, to paste additional new objects.<br /><br /></pre>

  <h3>2.1.4.3 Direct Manipulation</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Direct manipulation allows a user to perform actions on objects by interacting directly with the objects. Dragging an object with a mouse and dropping it on another object is one form of direct manipulation. Moving, copying, printing, and deleting are examples of actions that can be accomplished using direct-manipulation techniques.<br /><br />Using direct-manipulation techniques is usually an easier method of performing actions than performing the equivalent actions from menu bars and pull-downs. For example, with direct manipulation a user can move a document from one container to another by dragging it to the new container. Using the pull-downs requires that a user first select the document, then select the <b>Copy</b> choice from a pull-down menu to copy the object to the clipboard and then paste the clipboard contents into the new folder.<br /><br />The user can perform other actions on objects by requesting a pop-up menu for an object. Pop-up menus can be thought of as a form of direct manipulation because they allow a user to more directly interact with an object, rather than through an intermediate control, such as a pull-down menu in a window that contains a choice that acts on a view of an object.<br /><br /><i>Related</i> <i>Topics</i>

  <h3>2.1.4.4 Scrolling</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Scrolling is used to display information in a view that does not fit within the current size of the window or the part of the window allocated for that information. For example, a long list of document names displayed in a window, or in a list box within a window, may require scroll enabling to allow a user to see all the names in the list.<br /><br />A scroll bar is used as a visual indication that information may be scrolled. A user can interact with a scroll bar using the pointing device to scroll the information. In addition the CUA guidelines define techniques for scrolling information using the keyboard.<br /><br /><i>Related</i> <i>Topics</i>

  <h3>2.1.4.5 Pointers and Cursors</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">A visible cue is provided for both the pointing device (such as a mouse) and the keyboard to show where interaction will occur. The visual cue for the pointing device is the pointer; the visual cue for the keyboard is the cursor. To avoid confusion as to where input will occur, only one pointer and one cursor are visible at a time.<br /><br />The user moves the pointer freely on the screen. Users can move the cursor to only valid cursor positions. For example, the cursor can be moved to the menu bar choices and push buttons, but not to field prompts or headings. When a user clicks the pointing device, the cursor is placed at the indicated position, if possible. A cursor never affects the pointer location.<br /><br />The CUA guidelines define the following types of pointers: an arrow pointer, an arrow pointer with augmentations, a wait pointer, and an I-beam pointer. Their descriptions follow in <a href="2.1.4.5?DT=19921204095534#FIGDUMMY">Figure 155</a>.<br /><br /><a id="FIGDUMMY" name="FIGDUMMY"></a><a id="TBLDUMMY" name="TBLDUMMY"> <br />_________________________________________________________________</a><br />| <span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 155.

A tool palette may be provided by a product to allow easy access to several actions. When a user selects a tool from a tool palette, the pointer shape changes and pointer interaction is determined by the tool. For example, selecting a line-drawing tool causes a line to be drawn as users drag the pointing device.<br /><br />CUA-interface guidelines define two types of cursors:<br /><br /><b style="font-weight: bold;">Selection</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b style="font-weight: bold;">cursor</b><br />A selection cursor is used for settings choices and for all objects. This cursor typically appears as a dotted outline box around the settings choice or the object. The cursor is usually seen even when other types of emphasis are displayed. For example, the selection cursor is visible on an object that is displayed with in-use emphasis.<br /><br /><b style="font-weight: bold;">Text</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b style="font-weight: bold;">cursor</b><br />A text cursor is used for keyboard text input. Two visuals are typically used for text cursors: a vertical bar to indicate insert mode and a colored background behind a character to indicate replace mode.<br /><br /><i>Related</i> <i>Topics</i>

  <h3>2.1.5.2 Audible Cues</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80">Audible cues are provided when a user attempts to perform an action that is not valid or when an event or state of the operating environment requires the user's attention. For example, when a user tries to select a choice displayed with unavailable-state emphasis, an audible cue should be generated. However, users can always specify in their operating environment that they want audible cues turned off.<br /><br />Audible cues can be anything from a beep to a recorded message. The only limit is the hardware your product runs on and the usefulness of the cue for your users.<br /><br /><i>Related</i> <i>Topics</i>

<br /><b>Fnd</b> Identify each control or field of controls with a field prompt, a column heading, or a window title, whichever is most appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Use a label that clearly indicates the control's function.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Immediately update a control when the value it represents changes. For example, if a slider and an entry field are provided to represent the same numerical value, immediately change the slider to represent the value entered into the entry field.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Use the controls provided by the operating environment rather than creating new ones.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid changing the function, interaction technique, or appearance of controls provided by the operating environment.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> When a window is sized, adjust the size of the controls. For example, make the entry fields longer or shorter as the window is sized larger or smaller. At some minimal useful size, clip the controls instead of adjusting the size.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> See Figures <a href="2.2.18?DT=19921204095534#FIGCONTRL">159</a> and<a href="2.2.18?DT=19921204095534#FIGNTEXT"> 160</a> on page <a href="2.2.18?DT=19921204095534#FIGCONTRL">2.2.18</a> and <a href="2.2.18?DT=19921204095534#FIGNOTE">Figure 161 </a>for the recommended usage of text and non-text controls.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGCONTRL" name="FIGCONTRL"></a><a id="TBLCONTRL" name="TBLCONTRL"> ___________________________________________________________________ </a><br />| <span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 159.

<br /><b>Fnd</b> Provide direct manipulation for all objects represented as icons on the workplace.<br /><br /><b>Guidelines</b>
<br /><b>Fnd</b> When a user presses the Cancel key or when a user drops an object onto the same position it currently occupies, cancel the direct-manipulation operation.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid changing the input focus as a result of a direct-manipulation operation.<br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Do not change which window is the active window when a direct-manipulation operation is performed.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Provide contextual help for direct-manipulation operations.<br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> If you provide contextual help for a direct-manipulation operation, allow a user to display contextual help about the direct-manipulation operation by pressing the Help key.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Allow a user to transfer data through direct manipulation. For example, when a user drags a document to a printer, prepare the document to be printed and schedule it to be printed on that printer.<br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> During a direct-manipulation operation, display source emphasis on the source object.<br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> During a direct-manipulation operation, if a target object is in a state where it can receive data as a result of the direct-manipulation operation, display target emphasis on the target object when the pointer is on that object.<br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> During a direct-manipulation operation, if a target object is in a state where it can receive data as a result of the direct manipulation operation, but cannot receive the object being directly manipulated, display target emphasis and change the pointer when the pointer is over that object. For example, change the pointer to the "do not" pointer.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> During a direct-manipulation operation on a single object, drag a copy of the icon or an outline of the object. If an identical image of an icon for that object is not available, substitute an outline of the object's icon.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> During a direct-manipulation operation on a group of objects where the spatial relationship between the objects in the group is not relevant for positioning in the view of the target object, such as on the workplace and in folders, drag a generic image of three overlapped objects.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If a direct-manipulation operation is performed on a group of objects and the requested action cannot be performed on all of the objects, perform the requested action on the valid objects and display a message giving completion information.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> During a direct-manipulation operation on a group of objects where the spatial relationship between the objects in the group is relevant for positioning in the view of the target object, such as in a composed view of an object, drag the objects while maintaining their relative positions.<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> When a user drags an image or an outline of an object to perform a copy operation, dim the image or outline as in Figures <a href="2.2.29?DT=19921204095534#FIGDUNNO">165</a> and <a href="2.2.29?DT=19921204095534#FIGKMFDM">166</a> on page <a href="2.2.29?DT=19921204095534#FIGDUNNO">2.2.29</a>.<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGDUNNO" name="FIGDUNNO"></a><a id="TBLDUNNO" name="TBLDUNNO"><br />______________________________________________________ </a><br />| <span style="font-style: italic;">Figure 165.

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />A commonly used pointing device, containing one or more buttons,<br />that allows a user to interact with a product or the operating<br />environment. A mouse button is mapped to one of three<br />functions: selection, manipulation, and displaying a pop-up<br />menu.<br /><br /><br /><b>Guidelines</b>
<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Assign mouse button one as the mouse selection button as the<br /> initial default for a two-button mouse.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Assign mouse button two as the mouse manipulation button as the<br /> initial default for a two-button mouse.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Assign the chording of mouse buttons one and two as the mouse<br /> menu button as the initial default for a two-button mouse.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> When a user clicks a mouse button, perform the function assigned<br /> to a click of that button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Design your product so that when a user double-clicks a mouse<br /> button, only the function assigned to a double-click of that<br /> button is performed. Do not allow the function assigned to a<br /> single click of that mouse button to be performed. For example,<br /> if a user double-clicks on an object, the object's selection<br /> state should remain unaffected, and the object should be opened.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Do not assign double-click as the only way to select a choice<br /> and perform an action. Provide a keyboard alternative, such as<br /> a menu choice or push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Do not assign double-click functions to choices on which users<br /> will typically perform multiple single clicks, such as on scroll<br /> bar buttons.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Perform the function assigned to a chord when a user presses<br /> more than one mouse button in such a way that the buttons are<br /> down and the mouse moves no more than the distance that the user<br /> has specified for the operating environment. Do not perform the<br /> functions assigned to clicking each mouse button individually.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> When a user presses the mouse selection button, move the input<br /> focus to the pointer position or to the closest part of the<br /> window that can receive the input focus.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid moving input focus to the pointer position when a user<br /> presses the mouse menu button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> If pop-up menus are provided, allow a user using a 3-button<br /> mouse to select a choice from the pop-up menu with either the<br /> mouse selection button or mouse menu button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Provide access to all functions of an object using equivalent,<br /> though not necessarily identical, mouse and keyboard techniques.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Assign the mouse-button functions for a one-button, two-button,<br /> and three-button mouse as in the following tables:<br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGSELECT" name="FIGSELECT"></a><a id="TBLSELECT" name="TBLSELECT"> _________________________________________________________ </a><br />| Figure 186.

<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Use a push button in a window with a menu bar to provide<br /> convenient access to a frequently-used action choice or routing<br /> choice.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> If a menu bar is not provided in a window displaying a view of<br /> an object, place all action and routing choices on push buttons<br /> in that window, except for those choices that appear on the<br /> system menu.<br /><br /><br /><b>Guidelines</b>
<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid placing settings choices on push buttons.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If one push button in a field is typically used most frequently<br /> by users, make that push button the default push button for the<br /> field.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If the cursor is on a push button, make that push button the<br /> default push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Assign the default push button according to the position of the<br /> cursor. For example, when a user moves the cursor to a control<br /> with associated push buttons, assign one of the associated push<br /> buttons as the default push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Assign a unique mnemonic to each textual push button choice that<br /> does not have a specific keyboard access mechanism, such as Esc<br /> for the <b>Cancel</b> push button or F1 for the <b>Help</b> push button,<br /> unless no meaningful unique mnemonic can be found.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> When a user types a mnemonic assigned to a push button, perform<br /> the action assigned to that push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> For push buttons that do not open a new window or close the<br /> current window, avoid moving the cursor when a user types a<br /> mnemonic to select a push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> If two push button choices are mutually exclusive, for example,<br /> <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo,</b> use two push buttons and display<br /> unavailable-state emphasis on whichever one is unavailable given<br /> the current state of the object. Do not change the label or the<br /> function of a push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Capitalize only the first letter of the first word of a choice<br /> appearing on a push button unless the choice contains an<br /> abbreviation, acronym, or proper noun that should be<br /> capitalized.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> When you provide a push button with the function of one of the<br /> predefined push buttons, use the predefined push-button label<br /> for that push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Label a product-defined action push button to indicate the<br /> action that will be applied to an object.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Label a product-specific routing push button to indicate the<br /> window or menu that the user will be routed to.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> When a push button is used for a routing choice, use an ellipsis<br /> following the choice text.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Place push buttons that affect the entire window horizontally at<br /> the bottom of the window and justified from the left edge.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If a window that can be scrolled contains push buttons that<br /> affect the entire window, scroll the area above the push<br /> buttons, keeping the push buttons visible.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If the action indicated by the label on a push button adjusts or<br /> is associated with a component within the same window as the<br /> push button, place the push button near that component. For<br /> example, if the function of a push button is to restore the<br /> initial value in an entry field, place that push button beside<br /> the entry field that it affects.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If a window contains a push button that affects a component in<br /> the window, scroll the push button along with the component when<br /> a user scrolls the window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If a push button adjusts (or is associated with) a component<br /> within a window (rather than the entire window), do not close<br /> the window when a user selects the push button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid using a push button to change the size of a window;<br /> instead, allow a user to change the size of the window using the<br /> size borders and the maximize push button. For example, do not<br /> provide a push button labeled <b>More&gt;&gt;</b> to allow a user to enlarge<br /> a window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> When a window contains push buttons and a menu bar, place, in<br /> the pull-down menus, choices that provide function that is<br /> equivalent to the push button functions that affect the entire<br /> window so that the push buttons provide convenient access to<br /> frequently-used choices in the pull-down menus.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Combine existing menu choices to create new push-button choices<br /> for frequently-used combinations of choices. For example, the<br /> <b>Save</b> and <b>New</b> choices could be combined into a new push-button<br /> choice called <b>Save</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> that would perform the <b>Save</b> action<br /> followed by the <b>New</b> action.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If push buttons contain choices that are also available through<br /> another mechanism, such as the menu bar or scroll bar, allow a<br /> user to hide or remove the push buttons.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Clip the push buttons at the bottom of the window when a user<br /> decreases the width of the window rather than reflowing the push<br /> buttons into multiple lines.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid using a group box around a field consisting only of push<br /> buttons.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> For push buttons that provide choices that can be used<br /> repeatedly, repeat the action as long as the user presses and<br /> holds the mouse selection button. Stop repeating the action<br /> when the user moves the pointer away from the push button and<br /> resume repeating the action if the user moves the pointer back<br /> over the push button without having released the mouse selection<br /> button.<br /><br /><br /><b>Essential</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Topics</b>

For example, place<br /> in a status area text that says "3 of 10 cars included."<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If only some objects are displayed in a window, indicate in that<br /> window's status area what criteria the objects met in order to<br /> be displayed in the window. For example, place in a status area<br /> text that says "Displaying documents created between 10/29/90<br /> and 2/1/91" or if a view of an object has been sorted, indicate<br /> in a status area the criteria used for sorting.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Provide only one status area in a window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If a user reduces the width of a window, compress the status<br /> area, if possible; otherwise, clip the status area.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Make the status area the same width as the window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Make the status area no taller than necessary to accommodate<br /> brief, but meaningful, information. For example, when using<br /> text, accommodate only one line of text.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> If you provide a status area, allow a user to turn the display<br /> of the status area on or off.

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />The guidelines for the placement of controls in a window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Guidelines</b>
<br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Design the initial size and layout of an action window so that a<br /> user will not typically need to scroll the window. If the<br /> initial size of an action window is not large enough to display<br /> all of the controls, place less frequently used controls out of<br /> view.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If more information is contained in a view than is visible in<br /> the initial size and layout of a window, ensure that the break<br /> between visible and hidden information is at a logical point.<br /> For example, avoid clipping an entry field so that only a<br /> portion of it is visible.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Within a column of controls, left-align the edges of the<br /> controls to the right of the longest field prompt.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If the contents of a window can be scaled when the window is<br /> sized, provide a user option to specify whether to scale or clip<br /> the contents.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> Place push buttons that affect the entire window horizontally at<br /> the bottom of the window and justified from the left edge.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If a window that can be scrolled vertically contains push<br /> buttons that affect the entire window, scroll the area above the<br /> push buttons, keeping the push buttons visible.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid placing push buttons in more than two rows.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If the action indicated by the label on a push button adjusts or<br /> is associated with a component within the same window as the<br /> push button, place the push button near that component. For<br /> example, if the function of a push button is to restore the<br /> initial value in an entry field, place that push button beside<br /> the entry field that it affects.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Avoid using a push button to change the size of a window;<br /> instead, allow a user to change the size of the window using the<br /> size borders and the maximize push button or <b>Maximize</b> choice.<br /> For example, do not provide a push button labeled <b>More&gt;&gt;</b> to<br /> allow a user to enlarge a window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Use a notebook to organize groups of controls when they will not<br /> fit in a single window. Avoid placing related controls in<br /> separate windows connected by routing choices on push buttons.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> In high-volume data-entry windows, consider using right-aligned<br /> edges of field prompts next to left-aligned entry fields so that<br /> a narrow vertical column of space is left between the field<br /> prompts and their associated entry fields to allow a user to<br /> quickly scan the choices in the window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> Allow a user to adjust the size of each column in a window,<br /> where appropriate. For example, provide column borders that a<br /> user can directly manipulate to change the size of columns.<br /><br /><br /><b>Fnd</b> If a user cannot adjust the width of a column or scroll the<br /> column, make the column at least as wide as the widest item in<br /> the column or as wide as the column's heading, whichever is<br /> wider.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If a user can adjust the width of a column, make the initial<br /> width of the column wide enough to display choices of average<br /> width.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If the order of columns can be changed, allow a user to directly<br /> manipulate each column. For example, allow a user to drag<br /> column headings to change the order of columns.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If you provide an information area, place it at the bottom of a<br /> window.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If you provide an information area and there is a horizontal<br /> scroll bar in the window, place the information area below the<br /> scroll bar and above the window border.<br /><br /><br /><b>Rec</b> If you provide a status area, place it below the title bar and<br /> below the menu bar, if a menu bar is provided, and above the<br /> rest of the window. For example, place a status area below the<br /> menu bar and above column headings in a window.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Essential</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Topics</b>

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />The CUA user interface has been designed to accommodate point-and-select<br />interaction techniques. Although the CUA user interface is primarily<br />intended for use with a pointing device such as a mouse, many CUA concepts<br />and techniques can be incorporated in products that accept <i>touch</i><br /><i>input</i>--that is, input generated when a user places a finger on a display<br /> screen.<br /><br /><br />The design process for products that accept touch input is the same as for<br />other kinds of products. However, a designer must be sure to accommodate<br />the input device: a user's finger. Because a finger is larger than a<br />cursor or pointer and can obscure objects and choices beneath it, a<br />designer must pay special attention to a product's interaction techniques<br />and visible cues to ensure that the result of a user's interaction is the<br />result the user intended. A designer must ensure that a user knows which<br />items can be selected. A designer must also ensure that a user is able to<br />select items easily and accurately.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Subtopics:<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />When using a product that accepts touch input, a user can:<br /><br /><br />&deg; Touch the display screen with a finger<br />&deg; Lift a finger from the display screen<br />&deg; Slide a finger while maintaining contact with the display screen.<br /><br /><br />Selection in a touch-input environment can occur at either the moment a<br />user touches the screen or the moment a user lifts a finger from the<br />screen.<br /><br /><br />Selection at the moment of the initial touch is the most intuitive method<br />for selection and requires the least amount of training for users.<br />However, this method of selection does not give a user the opportunity to<br />cancel a selection once finger contact is made. If a designer chooses<br />this method of selection, the designer should make the visual<br />representations of a product's objects and choices relatively large. A<br />designer should also provide mechanisms that make it easy for a user to<br />identify errors and correct them.<br /><br /><br />Selection at the moment a user lifts a finger from the display screen<br />allows a user to cancel an impending selection by sliding the finger away<br />from an item before lifting the finger from the display screen. If a<br />designer chooses this method of selection, the designer should provide<br />some kind of visual highlighting on each object or choice that a user<br />touches so that the user knows the item will be selected if the user lifts<br />the finger. Users might require more training before they can use this<br />method effectively to select objects and cancel selection.<br /><br /><br />In a variation of the second method of selection, a user touches the<br />screen, slides the finger until the desired item is highlighted, then<br />lifts the finger to select the highlighted item. This method works well<br />for small or closely spaced items. If a designer chooses this method of<br />selection, the designer should provide blank areas on the display screen<br />so that a user can cancel an impending selection.<br /><br /><br />Some display screens can differentiate between a light touch and a heavier<br />touch. For these displays a designer might specify a light touch for<br />sliding a finger to an item and a heavier touch for selecting an item.<br /><br /><br />A designer can combine these different methods of selection. For example,<br />a designer might specify that a user can select a choice on the menu bar<br />at the moment the user touches the choice. Then, when the corresponding<br />pull-down menu appears, the user could slide the finger up or down the<br />pull-down menu until the desired choice is highlighted. The highlighted<br />choice would be selected at the moment the user lifts the finger from the<br />screen. This method is similar to the pointing device method used for<br />selecting choices from menu bars and pull-down menus.<br /></pre>

A multimedia user interface<br />allows a user to work with more complex types of information, such as<br />synchronized audio and video information. In addition to text and simple<br />graphics, a multimedia user interface typically makes use of:<br /><br /><br />&deg; Images, both static and moving, recorded and synthesized<br />&deg; Audio, both recorded and synthesized.<br /><br /><br />The CUA environment allows the use of multimedia information.

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />A multimedia object has certain unique characteristics that affect the way<br />a designer should display the object in a product. A multimedia object is<br />typically a collection of data presented to a user in succession. To be<br />displayed correctly, the data in a multimedia object must be presented to<br />a user in the correct sequence and at the correct time. For example, an<br />animation sequence is presented to a user as a series of images rather<br />than as a single image. For the sequence to play correctly, each frame<br />must appear in the correct relative order, and the interval from the<br />appearance of one frame to the appearance of the next must be constant and<br />must match the interval at which the sequence was developed. Otherwise,<br />the motion in the sequence will seem jerky.<br /><br /><br />Multimedia objects can be combined. For example, a video object can be<br />combined with an audio object. To achieve the desired effect, however, a<br />designer must synchronize the objects. That is, a designer must link<br />segments of data from each object so that the two segments will be<br />displayed at the same point in time.<br /><br /><br />A designer can use standard components of the CUA interface, such as<br />windows and controls, to display a multimedia object. For example, a<br />product could display the waveform for an audio signal in a window. A<br />user could see different parts of the waveform by scrolling the contents<br />of the window.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGWAVEFRM" name="FIGWAVEFRM"> </a><a href="picture-301?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 301" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P301.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Figure 207. Displaying a Multimedia Object. A multimedia object can be<br />displayed in a window. In the example above, the two windows<br />display the same object, but they represent different segments<br />of the object that correspond to different points in time. To<br />view or work with a particular segment of the multimedia<br />object, a user can scroll the window.<br /><br /><br />However, a designer should keep in mind that a scroll bar indicates the<br />position and quantity of the information visible in a window only in<br />relation to the quantity of information in the entire object being<br />displayed. A scroll bar does not represent an absolute position or<br />quantity.<br />Therefore, a scroll bar can be used to adjust the view of the object<br />displayed in the window, but it should not be used to represent or adjust<br />a specific quantity, such as time.<br /><br /><br />Instead, a designer should use a slider to represent a specific quantity.<br />For example, in a product used for video editing, a designer could use a<br />slider to indicate the total length (or time) of a "master tape" object.<br />The slider arm would indicate the specific position or point in time of a<br />single frame of the tape. To view the preceding (earlier) or following<br />(later) frames, a user could manipulate the slider arm.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGSLIDERF" name="FIGSLIDERF"> </a><a href="picture-302?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 302" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P302.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Figure 208.

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />A multimedia user interface can place considerable demands on a user's<br />computer system. Factors that affect a user's ability to manage and<br />manipulate multimedia objects include:<br /><br /><br />&deg; Size, color, and resolution of a user's display screen<br /><br /><br />&deg; Adapter cards and peripheral hardware, such as video or audio players<br />or recorders<br /><br /><br />&deg; System memory and storage capacity.<br /><br /><br />A designer should be aware that some users of a product might not have all<br />the hardware necessary for an ideal installation. To accommodate a wider<br />range of users, a product should include options for users with various<br />system configurations. For example, a product developed on an elaborate<br />system might contain an animation sequence that makes use of the system's<br />high resolution and many colors. The product should also include a<br />mechanism that allows a user to view the sequence on a less elaborate<br />system that has lower resolution and fewer colors.<br /></pre>

Considerations for the Use of Color</a></h1>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br />Color serves as a visible cue that can draw a user's attention to--or away<br />from--a particular component of an interface. By using color, a designer<br />can improve the appearance and effectiveness of a product's user<br />interface. However, a designer should use color with care. If the colors<br />in an interface are poorly chosen and poorly applied, the usability of the<br />interface can be diminished.<br /><br /><br />Because some users might not have access to a color display screen, and<br />because some users might have varying degrees of color blindness, a<br />designer shouldn't rely solely on color to distinguish one interface<br />component from another. Color should be used in combination with other<br />cues, such as tonal value (contrast), size, shape, placement, and overlap.<br />In fact, designers should design the interface in black and white first<br />and should add color only after achieving a satisfactory design in black<br />and white.<br /><br /><br />In general, a designer should use fewer colors and should apply them<br />sparingly. Certain color combinations should be avoided. A red image on<br />a green background, or a green image on a red background, can be difficult<br />to see, particularly if the colors are of the same intensity. A designer<br />should be aware that many users have red-green color blindness. Also,<br />because saturated red and blue lines can appear to have depth, a designer<br />should use them with care. Lighting conditions can also affect the<br />visibility of colors. Before specifying colors for a user interface, a<br />designer should consult someone skilled in the application of color to<br />user interfaces.<br /><br /><br />Because users seek meaning in colors, a designer should take special care<br />to learn what a particular color represents to a product's intended users.<br />For example, in many Western cultures the color red means "stop" or<br />"unsatisfactory conditions," the color yellow means "caution," and the<br />color green means "go" or "satisfactory conditions." If a designer is<br />certain that the users of a product will ascribe those meanings to those<br />colors, the designer can use the colors to convey those meanings.<br />However, if a product will be used by an international audience, a<br />designer should not assume that red, yellow, and green will mean the same<br />things to all users.<br /><br /><br />A designer should use the same color to convey the same meaning within a<br />particular scope. For example, if the border of an entry field in a<br />notebook changes to red when a user places an inappropriate value in the<br />entry field, the border colors of other controls in the notebook should<br />also change to red when a user supplies an inappropriate value. A<br />designer could use red to convey a different meaning in the same product<br />as long as the red appears in a different scope. For example, if a<br />designer uses a slider to represent temperature, the designer could make<br />one end of the slider red and the other blue to represent hot and cold,<br />respectively.<br /><br /><br />Finally, whenever a designer includes color in a user interface, the<br />designer should also provide mechanisms that allow a user to change the<br />color. A designer should also provide a default set of colors that a user<br />can revert to after changing to other colors.<br /></pre>

  <h2>D.1 General Considerations for
National Language and the CUA
Guidelines</h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre></pre>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />The following clarifies some of the CUA guidelines when applied to a<br />National Language environment.<br /><br /><br /><b>Capitalization</b> The guidelines stated for capitalization in this<br /> manual are for the English language developer. When a<br /> product is developed in another language or translated<br /> to another language, the rules of that language must<br /> be followed. For example, in the German language all<br /> nouns are capitalized, no matter what their position<br /> in a phrase or sentence.<br /><br /><br /><b>Column</b> <b>Headings</b> The space needed for a column heading after<br /> translation may increase. For usability purposes, the<br /> additional space may be achieved by increasing the<br /> number of rows in the heading.<br /><br /><br /><b>Descriptive</b> <b>Text</b> Descriptive text will sometimes reflect a localized or<br /> culturally sensitive format. Allow the user to edit<br /> the descriptive text in place.<br /><br /><br /><b>Field</b> <b>Prompts</b> The translation of field prompts may cause a field to<br /> be moved. Fields must be realigned after translation.<br /><br /><br /><b>First-Letter</b> <b>Cursor</b> <b>Navigation</b><br />Allow a user to press the unaccented, uppercase, or<br />lowercase character to access accented first letters.<br /><br /><br /><b>Icon</b> An icon designed for the international market place<br /> should follow these additional design criteria.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Avoid body parts<br />&deg; Use international symbols where possible<br />&deg; Do not include text<br />&deg; If alphabetic characters are included, use<br />uppercase<br />&deg; Avoid symbolic written material that is oriented<br />for left-to-right text<br />&deg; Avoid stars and crosses<br />&deg; Do not use humor<br />&deg; Do not use regional metaphors.<br /><br /><br /><b>Length</b> <b>of</b> <b>Text</b> When a product will be translated to another language,<br /> developers should consider translation space when<br /> evaluating length of text in entry fields. For<br /> example, CUA guidelines recommend 60 or fewer<br /> characters in a single-line entry field. If the<br /> product will be translated, 40 or fewer characters are<br /> recommended.<br /><br /><br /><b>Shortcut</b> <b>Keys</b> The use of Alt+(A-Z) for shortcut keys can be very<br /> awkward on non-US keyboards since only either the left<br /> hand Alt key or the right hand Alt key may be<br /> available for this function.<br /><br /><br /><b>Sort</b> Each country has a different way of sorting, and may<br /> have several ways of sorting within the country, such<br /> as in a telephone book or a dictionary. The sort menu<br /> should be defined by each country or application. The<br /> sort menu may have to allow selection of these<br /> criteria based on the requirements of the country or<br /> application. In addition, when lists are ordered<br /> alphabetically, as in spin buttons, the list must be<br /> reordered after translation.<br /></pre>

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />The following are some of the special considerations when applying the CUA<br />guidelines to Double-Byte Character Sets.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Mnemonic Selection: A <i>mnemonic</i> is a single character that provides a<br /> fast interaction technique for selecting choices from the keyboard.<br /> When users type a valid mnemonic, the selection cursor moves to the<br /> choice that the mnemonic is assigned to and the choice is<br /> automatically selected or deselected as appropriate. This saves<br /> keystrokes for choices that are usually selected explicitly.<br /><br /><br />All the guidelines for mnemonics in a single-byte-character-set (SBCS)<br />language apply to a double-byte-character-set (DBCS) language except<br />for how the mnemonics are shown. If all the letters in a choice are<br />already assigned, or the choice consists of DBCS characters, you may<br />choose another letter or a keyboard character, such as the comma (,).<br />Choices that appear many times in an application should be assigned<br />the same mnemonic throughout.<br /><br /><br />Applications translated from SBCS languages to DBCS languages can keep<br />the SBCS mnemonics.<br /><br /><br />&deg; DBCS Keyboard Shift Status: In the DBCS environment, the Presentation<br />Manager has the capability to display the keyboard shift status in the<br />information area. This technique should be used in primary and<br />secondary windows that accept keyboard data entry for DBCS<br />applications.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Sort: For components, such as the combination box control, that<br />specify choices should be shown in a specific sort order such as<br />alphabetic order, the sort order may actually depend on the<br />application. For example, for Japanese Kanji it may be better to sort<br />by Japanese phonetic order or some other appropriate order depending<br />on the information in the field.<br /></pre>

  <h2>D.3 Bidirectional Languages</h2>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />The main factor affecting CUA guidelines for users of bidirectional<br />languages (Arabic and Hebrew) is the right-to-left (RTL) orientation of<br />these languages; Hebrew or Arabic text is written from right to left and<br />from top to bottom. However, English words and numbers are written from<br />left to right (LTR). This makes bidirectionality a must in any system<br />intended for Arabic or Hebrew users.<br /><br /><br /><b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>bidirectional</b> <b>applications.</b>
<br /><br />In CUA-interface-conforming applications, all pieces of data must<br />be displayed in the orientation that is correct for the<br />application user. Data input must be supported in the orientation<br />that is natural for users.<br /><br /><br />General information concerning the Arabic language can be found in<br /><cite>National</cite> <cite>Language</cite> <cite>Information</cite> <cite>and</cite> <cite>Design</cite> <cite>Guide,</cite> <cite>Volume</cite> <cite>3:</cite> <cite>Arabic</cite> <cite>Script</cite><br /><cite>Languages,</cite> <cite>(SE09-8003)</cite>. This publication describes the Arabic language,<br /> and the main keyboard functions implemented on terminals and programmable<br /> workstations with Arabic support.<br /><br /><br />General information concerning the Hebrew language may be found in<br /><cite>National</cite> <cite>Language</cite> <cite>Information</cite> <cite>and</cite> <cite>Design</cite> <cite>Guide,</cite> <cite>Volume</cite> <cite>4:</cite> <cite>Hebrew</cite><br />(SE09-8004). This publication describes the Hebrew language, and the main<br />keyboard functions implemented on terminals and programmable workstations<br />with Hebrew support.<br /><br /><br />In most cases, Arabic and Hebrew can be handled in the same way. We will<br />use "Arabic and Hebrew" as a generic designator for the national language<br />used by a bidirectional application. Whenever special considerations<br />apply to Arabic only or to Hebrew only, they will be mentioned explicitly.<br /><br /><br />In all examples, Arabic and Hebrew text is represented by lowercase Latin,<br />written from right to left. English text is represented by uppercase,<br />although in reality it would be written in mixed case, if appropriate.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Subtopics:<br /></pre>

  <h3>D.3.2 Orientation</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />Arabic and Hebrew applications, since written for the Arabic and Hebrew<br />language, use the screen space in RTL orientation. Thus the right side of<br />a window becomes the "begin" side, and its left side is the "end" side.<br />Most references to "right" and "left" in the CUA guidelines for LTR<br />languages remain true in Arabic and Hebrew, providing that "right" and<br />"left" are exchanged (in some cases, "right" and "left" must be conserved<br />as-is for Arabic and Hebrew. They are mentioned in the following<br />paragraph).<br /><br /><br />The appearance of an Arabic and Hebrew window is mostly the mirror<br />symmetric of a corresponding English window ("mostly" because the position<br />of system and maximize and minimize push buttons in the title bar does not<br />change. A discussion about vertical scroll bars appears in the following<br />paragraphs).<br /><br /><br />For instance, a window with some choices could look like <a href="D.3.2?DT=19921204095534#FIGWINWC">Figure 211</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a id="FIGWINWC" name="FIGWINWC"> </a><a href="picture-305?mode=zoom"><img alt="PICTURE 305" src="/bookmgr/pictures/f29al000.19921204095534.P305.GIF" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Figure 211. Window with Choices<br /><br /><br />It must be understood that orientation applies at multiple levels:<br /><br /><br />&deg; In a bidirectional environment, the end user selects the orientation<br />of the workplace (for example, screen orientation). Selection is done<br />according to the user's main usage, standards, or preferences and<br />controls the way the screen and windows are organized. If this<br />orientation is RTL:<br /><br /><br />- Windows are tiled, cascaded, or superimposed with the older<br />primary window on the right and the newer secondary on the left<br /><br /><br />- Application icons are ordered from right-to-left beginning from<br />the right side of the screen.<br /><br /><br />- In a workplace environment, icons should be originally ordered<br />from right-to-left and top-to-bottom if there is a meaningful<br />sequence among them.<br /><br /><br />&deg; An application has a general orientation for its windows, which is LTR<br />for English applications and generally RTL for Arabic and Hebrew<br />applications.<br /><br /><br />&deg; A window has an orientation. If the window orientation is RTL, its<br />elements are logically ordered from right-to-left and from<br />top-to-bottom.<br /><br /><br />For a RTL window, the priority for positioning associated secondary<br />windows (like help windows) is: to the left of, to the right of,<br />above, or below the application window.<br /><br /><br />Note that an Arabic or Hebrew application can include some LTR<br />windows.<br /><br /><br />Note also that a LTR window can be used on a RTL screen and<br />vice-versa. This means that English services and applications can be<br />used while the screen is oriented RTL and Arabic and Hebrew (RTL)<br />applications can be used on a LTR screen.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Within the same window, text and graphics may have differing<br />orientations. This may be the case, for instance, for a geographic<br />map where the graphics will be left-to-right (as for an English<br />application), but the Arabic and Hebrew captions will be<br />right-to-left.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Entry fields are a special case: for each field, an orientation is<br />defined, which by default is RTL within RTL windows. However, fields<br />which are to receive numeric data or English text should be defined as<br />LTR oriented.<br /><br /><br />Within an entry field, the keying (or cursor) direction may be RTL or<br />LTR, according to the data entered (Arabic or Hebrew text, or English<br />and numbers).<br /><br /><br />More explanations on entry fields will be found in the following<br />paragraphs.<br /><br /><br /><b>Note:</b> While the "right" and "left" have exchanged their meaning, the<br /> physical right and left are still the same, thus the following have the<br /> same effect for Arabic and Hebrew as for English:<br /><br /><br />&deg; Cursor movement keys (left and right arrows) must still move the<br />cursor according to the direction of the arrow engraved on the key top<br />(this is also true for combinations of the left and right arrow keys<br />with Shift, Ctrl or Alt).<br /><br /><br />Likewise, Ctrl+PgUp must always scroll to the left, and Ctrl+PgDn<br />scroll to the right.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Right and left buttons of a pointing device.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Right and left movement of a pointing device.<br /><br /><br />&deg; Graphics may be unaffected by the window orientation: for instance, a<br />map must still have the East on the right side and the West on the<br />left side.<br /></pre>

It overrides<br /> the application-defined field orientation for the current entry operation.<br /> For instance, a "customer name" field, defined as having RTL orientation,<br /> is overridden to LTR orientation in order to type the name of an English<br /> customer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Push/EndPush</i>: These functions allow the typing of a piece of text with an<br /> orientation opposite to the general orientation of the field. This may be<br /> used to type numbers or English words within a RTL field, or Arabic and<br /> Hebrew words within a LTR field.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>AutoPush</i>: This feature (which can be enabled or disabled by the user)<br /> automatically exercises the Push and EndPush functions when certain<br /> characters are typed. For instance, typing digits or English letters<br /> within a RTL field automatically begins a Push operation; typing Arabic or<br /> Hebrew afterwards begins an EndPush operation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Bidirectional</i> <i>Status</i> <i>Window</i>: This function puts a window on the screen<br /> that displays the status of all bidirectional indicators.<br /></pre>

If the field<br /> scrolls, the Right-Arrow key moves the cursor to the beginning of the<br /> field, while information scrolls left.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Word-Left</i> <i>Key</i>: The Word-Left key moves the cursor to the first logical<br /> position of the word on the left of the nearest blank to the left on the<br /> line.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Word-Right</i> <i>Key</i>: The Word-Right key moves the cursor to the first logical<br /> position of the word on the right of the nearest blank to the right on the<br /> line.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Delete</i> <i>Key</i> <i>in</i> <i>RTL</i> <i>Text</i>: If something is selected, this key deletes the<br /> selection. If no selection exists (for example, in <b>Insert</b> mode), it<br /> deletes the character to the left of the text cursor. Characters to the<br /> left of the deleted character move right to fill the vacated position.<br /> The cursor remains stationary at the point where the character was<br /> deleted.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Backspace</i> <i>Key</i> <i>in</i> <i>RTL</i> <i>Text</i>: If something is selected, this key deletes the<br /> selection. If no selection exists (for example, in <b>Insert</b> mode), it<br /> deletes the character to the right of the cursor and moves the cursor one<br /> space to the right. The characters to the left of the cursor move right<br /> one position to fill the vacated space. The Backspace key has no effect<br /> when the cursor is at the beginning of an entry field.<br /><br /><br /><b>Note:</b> The descriptions given in this section are only an overview.

  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />The terminology used in your product should be suited to the task domain<br />of the product's users. For example, if the primary users of a product<br />are programmers, use terms programmers are familiar with and understand;<br />similarly, if the primary users are members of the medical community or<br />the insurance community, use terms those users will expect and understand.<br /><br /><br />If your product has a particular implementation of a concept that you want<br />to include in the definition, you may append that information to the end<br />of the definition. Precede the appended information with a phrase such<br />as: <tt>In</tt> <i><u>myproduct</u></i><tt>,.</tt><tt>.</tt><tt>.</tt><tt>.</tt>
<br /><br />Predefined user-interface terminology (terms that appear in the table in<br /><b>bold</b> text) must be used for all users. Synonyms for these terms are not<br /> allowed.<br /></pre>

  <h3>F.2 How to Use This Table</h3>





  
  
  
  
  <pre width="80"><!-- * --><br /><br /><br />Use the terms and their definitions in your product documentation just as<br />they appear in the following table. Some of the terms that appear as<br />choices on the user interface can either be action or routing choices. If<br />they are used by your product as routing choices, append either an<br />ellipsis or a right-pointing arrow to the term as appropriate.<br /><br /><br />Some of the technical terms in this table do not have equivalent user<br />terms. To help you explain to users the concepts represented by these<br />technical terms, suggestions are given in the right-hand column of the<br />table. The documentation suggestions appear in <i>italic</i> text to distinguish<br /> them from term definitions.<br /><br /><br />Other technical terms in the table have equivalent user terms; for<br />example, look at the term "action message" in the table. In the<br />right-hand column, you are referred to "message" for the definition;<br />"message" is the user equivalent of "action message."<br /><br /><br /><b>Note:</b> Predefined capitalization rules have been applied to the<br /> user-interface terminology in the following table. Terms in <b>bold</b> text<br /> appear in CUA-conforming user interfaces as choices in menus, labels on<br /> push buttons, and labels associated with icons.<br /><br /><br /></pre>
